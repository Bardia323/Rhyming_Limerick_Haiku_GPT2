A new book was published today,
And it's called The Island of the Bay.
It's a book on the coast
Of the Gulf, and it's roast
With a note that it's not to say.

This is the last time I'm writing this lim
(Or else I'll be dead). I've got to dim
My lamp, and I'm sure
I'll miss the next bloor.
I'll miss you, and I won't miss the limb.

In the city of New York, you'll find
A long-standing, very well-defined mind.
It's a place you might call
New York's home, and fall
For its name.  It's the city that's the kind.

I'm a bit of a braggart.  I boast
That I'm the best at what I'm known as.  Ghost!
I'm a star.  I'm a star.
I am.  I am.  Are
You satisfied?  Well, then, at least, at most.

When you're hunting for a mate, you must
Look for a mate with a sweet, juicy bust.
If you're lucky, you'll find
A beautiful young kind—
But that's just what you'll find if you bust.

When the weather is balmy and clear,
And the wind is not too strong, dear,
Then I'll be sure that you
Will find me a good too,
But I'm not likely to be here.

Said the judge, "This case is no longer fair.
You're a convicted felon, there and there.
Now, I don't care what you say,
Let's just get it done OK.
You've been sentenced to take off your hair."

I'm a bit of a rebel: I'm free,
A true rebel, a rebel, you see.
I'm a rebel, and I
Wish to die, but I'll die
If I don't; I've got to be.

The best of us, we are told,
Are the ones who've got the most gold.
But I'm not so sure
That it's the best of more
That we've got, and I'm getting cold.

With the word dank, the word was used
To describe a place that you'd cruised
On a ship or a plane
That was dank, but in vain,
When you disembarked, you were excused.

The wildest of the wild, the wildest,
Was the wildest of the wild, and it's cursed
For the beasts that may be
In the wild with me.
I'll be dead before it's done first.

I'm a man of my word: I'm a gentleman.
I'll make sure that my words don't contention
To be rude or mean.
I'm a guy who's clean:
I'm a gentleman, my attention.

You've got claret-blue-green hair,
And your eyes are all white.  That's not there.
You've got blue-green eyes
And a nose, I surprise,
Which is why you're called the Blue Blue Rare.

I'm a dark-skinned, black-skinned, black-furred man,
And I'm well known as a black-furred man.
I don't own a wife,
But my wife's a life
That's full of adventure, no plan.

The word chum was an error, I fear.
Did the first use of it mean "here"?
Or "out there" (as in "there"?)?
Or "chum" (as in "hair"?)?
Or "chum" (as in "chum" or "chum" or "chum"?) or "beer"?

As a kid, I had a big crush on a chick.
She was hot, and her hands were so quick.
But she turned out to be
Not a very good me,
So I got some things my dad had a trick.

My wife was a bit of a slob.
I had thought I could be her new job.
She said, "You're a fool,
A bad, a lame, a tool."
I said, "You're the best of the best job."

In the daytime, the weather's balmy,
But at night the skies are a-glisteningly holly.
You'll find me in the sky
In the clouds, where the sky
Is a dark, mordant, and dusky dolly.

The word's a bit of a cheat;
It's not the same as a note.
It's a word that is rare
And a word that is there
In a word that is much more great.

A large, thick, thick, and thickly cut tree
(A weeping cedar) will please me.
It's a tree that's known
As a cedar it's own,
And it's named for a bird that I see.

The sun shone, and we became one.
We've been married for years, and it's fun.
And I'm sure that this is true
About you, too.  You
Will be surprised if you're not done.

My grandmother always said, "I'm a fool.
I'm too old for this stuff. It's too cool.
I'm too old for this stuff,
And it's not enough
To be so old as a rule."

I'm a man of my word, you see.
I don't cheat or steal or cheat on me.
I'm a man of my word
And I'm not absurd.
And I don't have to pay you — you're free.

The old man, a farmer, was a crook.
He was caught, and the judge said, "You're a hook.
'Cause you're not really a farmer,
I'll give you a bender,
But you're not a farmer, you're a book!"

The Indians' chief deity, they say,
Was a god of the earth all day.
But the gods he made
Were the ones who would fade
As they were replaced by a new way.

The adverb adverb's used to express
A change in stress, or a change in press.
But if you're using it
To mean "change in it"
It's a word that I'd rather confess.

In the woods, the batsman's in need
Of a new ball.  So he'll have to proceed
To the field, where he'll find
A new bat—a new kind—
And he'll bat it to score a run-out seed.

The cost of a gallon of gas
Is the price that you pay for alas.
But when you're paying with glee,
You'll be paying to see
That your bill's paid, no question pass.

The old cat's out of the bag, so to speak.
He's out of the game, and he's weak.
He's not a threat, so much,
But his behaviour's such
That his weakness is quite clearly weak.

You're a student of the arts, you say?
And you're proud of your work? That's your way.
And you're generous, kind?
I'll give you a find—
I'll give you a pat on the back each day.

The first thing I did was to look
For a good book on which to study.  I took
A look at the M.O.D.
For the book was just mood:
"Achievement, the goal of a book."
