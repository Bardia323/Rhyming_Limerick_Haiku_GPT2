A casket maker, known for his craft,
Saw a young lady he called "calfed."
A casket made the mold
Of this young girl, so cold.
She was buried with him, and was fraught.

When a boy and his girl met, they were both charmed
When they first looked in each other's eyes enthralled.
But, once they'd kissed, the two
Laughed and found it who
Was more than just a kiss that was scald.

The fat hood's a term that is more old.
It's the snot of a heck of a bold.
It is not how I feel
'Cause I'm no fool to deal
With a little bit more than that bold.

When a blind date comes around, we're all in a tizzy.
She can't see, so we're all a lizzy.
We're curious, but she
Drags her hand—we can't see—
Which means we're all totally in a bizzy!

There's a limerick, called "A Tale of My Youth,"
That's quite clearly a mess of uncouth.
It's a bit of a mess
And it's written, "Yes,"
In the weirdest possible way—it's the truth.

The cool of the morning came
As I came out to meet my dear dame.
She was wearing a
Dark velvet dress. A
Ironic remark?  I blame!

Brother Joes was a freakish little guy
Whose mother, a woman, would supply.
She bought him a pair
Of Moles, but he didn't there
And began to eat all the others.  That's my guy.

The old ploughman found it quite a pain
To deepen his pit, so a harvest he'd gain.
He'd work a field, but
He'd keep the darned thing shut.
"If I dig it up, I'll not dig the campaign."

The Black Knight, a sword from the past,
Has a sharp, narrow hilt that's quick and fast.
It's an axe, but it's not.
You can't deal with a lot
Of a knight, man, and the knight, of the last.

I'm sorry, Doc; I'm not in the mood
To dance or to dance in the nude.
But I must confess
When I want to guess
What's in my blood, it's blood thickened food.

In the winter, the weather gets cold,
So my wife and I get attacked by mold.
She's growing moss in a bottle,
And I just can't reveal
That I'm really a sucker for this told.

A tense plasma, when it's agitated,
Is a stress response.  Unabated,
It's a stressor and stress,
And it's not a guess—
When it's fully contracted, it's unabated.

A wild cormorant went hunting for prey
And he found a target to hunt for play.
He heard a young man,
As he stalked the wild plan,
Climbed a high wall to hear her say.

The town of Ardsley (not a real name)
Was a popular spot in the game
Of chess. Bert made his name
In the early game of this game,
And to this day they call him a "Fame".

In a beefsteak, hot-dogs and baked beans
Are what you'll find, for this dish, what it means.
When you're dining on beef
And you're hungry, you'll feel grief
To find there isn't beef in your beans.

I have arrived with my suit and my gun,
And we're going on trial.  What's been done?
I'll be a witness for you
And I'll tell you it's true
That I'll be charging the gun on your son.

The land that I've called home since I was young
Has been cut off, my family all hung
In the rain. Now it's wet,
But I can't get away get
The hell out of my house.  It's stung.

In the past, we used to kiss and embrace
In a solemn ceremony of love's face.
But now we kiss with a wink
And our love might not think
Of affectionate kisses in their place.

For the final judgment, I can't wait
Till the day of the day of the eight.
The day of the day
Will now mark the end of the day.
I will have the last meal of the date.

Folks have spread the word, and they're here.
They're spreading a rumor that's beer.
But what's more, they're spreading it
Around, so folks know it.
It's a e-bomb, not just a rumor, beer.

My grandpa was a dandy who'd beaming
When he saw that our mom was being flaming.
But the kids would whine
And say, "Dad, you stole mine!"
We had been caught in his grasp of dooming.

My horse takes to the road where it's wide.
Takes a path that's clear as can be denied.
If I should veer to the left,
I'd be far from bereft
Of the advantages that divided.

A cotenoid's a shape that's not flat.
It's a shape that's much longer than that.
It's a projection, I'm told,
Of a man's chest, which behold
What a man could be if he'd been flat.

It's the hills of the sun—the red and the gold,
Overflowing with light and I'm told.
It's a sight to behold
And to gaze at scorned
By the sun—and the heat makes me cold.

I'm a watermelon fan, as you'll see.
I like the fruit of a young knee.
Not shaped like a spear,
But juicy and shear,
I adore this fruit, so I love me.

Did a little girl who lived in a shack
Have a man in her life as a Czech?
Yes, not a village, not town,
But a town in the down
And the dockside that suited her back.

There's a new kid on the block:
His mother's a nasty old shock.
Though he misses his mom,
He's so darn good at dumb
That she calls him "the cock of the chock."

Cities, when they've reached their zenith,
In a furtive fashion entwined, are beneath
Their dwellings, through houses
And other houses and spouses,
Saying to each other, "Come, let us dance to the zenith!"

Now he's gotten my picture (he's been known),
I've been paid. If I can't be flown,
I'll be paid by the hour
By my own power.
I'll be paid by the minute, now he's shown.

I'm a girl with baldness, you'll note;
And the cause is most likely a boat.
Though my friends may call it
'Cause I'm weak—I'll wave it—
I must let go of my bladder and float.

To the casual observer, I'm a star.
I'm a best-looking guy, you are!
You'd think I'd be hot
With a smile and a shot,
But am I really so classy, bar bar?

I'm the most awesome chick on the block.
I can run like a top at the clock.
When I'm young, I will race
On the track, not embrace
It. Here's the reason: I'm a shock.

When a tent was pitched on the South Atlantic,
That's all that could be gleaned from the Atlantic.
But the same could be said
Of the Southern red
And the dark blue of the Atlantic.

I've been told my new dress is quite austere.
It's a silken, crepe and lace made here,
And I think it's too light
For the cold winter night
(And it's pretty darn soft when you're bare).

My house is quite a large place
And I will fill it to the top with space.
I've got a big yard
And I'm sure that it's hard
To find any place to put my face.

A word that I really should know.
It's the same as when you go.
Like when you're coming to
The end and you're through,
So you don't have to bother with "go."
