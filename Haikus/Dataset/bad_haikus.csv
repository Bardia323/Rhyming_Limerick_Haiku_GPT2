you do a lot more talking in your sleep,than you used to do now you're growing old,i wonder what there is for me to keep
look back: you see the path we chose was steep,and needed all our strength  but we were bold,it took our breath and left us only sleep
there was a time when talk of love came cheap,and what was bought was what the other sold,there was so much we didn't think to keep
if all those words were piled up in a heap,of gold like tokens of love bright and cold,would you desire them or ask for sleep
only know you've been high when you're feeling low,disgust the road when you're missing' home,only know you love her when you let her go
t,s,eliot would've been ashamed of me
nothing is past nothing is lost,one brief moment and all will be as it was before,how we shall laugh at the trouble of parting when we meet again
father breath once more farewell,birth you gave was no thing ill,my heart is still as time will tell
your eyes were fixed,staring at nothing and,turning into pale blue
the funeral is sad and i cry even though i never knew the boy in the coffini cry because things have to end,why can't they be endless,i cry cause death is heart-breakingi cry for his family's pain
crumbled lives,never to be again,scattered like leaves
cute and hot,mountain and beaches,rose gold and the color of peaches
five languages she knows,lena na usse panga,ycm ke peeche at swarganga
o soft and dainty maiden from afar,i watch you as amidst the flowers you move,and pluck them singing
more golden than all gold your tresses are,never was harp-note like your voice my love,your voice sweet-ringing
they have been whispering in my ears,besides my heart doth presume,as thou art my life's pearl
locked up in passion,never make a promise,but i'll be what he
learning on a curve,and im certain they couldn't stop,the pace in case you doubted

way down south in dixie,they hung my black young lover,to a cross roads tree
way down south in dixie,i asked the white lord jesus,what was the use of prayer
way down south in dixie,love is a naked shadow,on a gnarled and naked tree
oh my god please don't tell me i failed,please lord just give me another chance,i promise i won't let you down
it happened in an instant like a flash of light,a burning deep within me like a shooting star or a crashing flight,like icarus before his demise
a never-ending supply,of food perhaps,asked god
no no,i said,and prayed and prayed
shall i offered god,remove all suffering,from the world
no i said,the world's already used to it,and i prayed and prayed
look you must tell me,what you want,said god now appearing a little irritated
oh well if you insist,i said,i want your job
for only in the gospel will my answers be,through the christ the redeemer my,redemption from this life of multiple lies
how seldom do we talk to god enquire his plan,why waste moments in planning the future,when all to be done is bow our head
yup you're not here for me,and i concede i'll never have,the pieces that you need
before i leave the stage,i will sing the only song,i was meant truly to sing
i live my lie,cause if the theory's true,love damned can't die
one last package sits lone at midnight sticking up out,of the coast rack high as the dusty fluorescent,light
let my hand touch yours,let me warm it if it's cold,my last warmth shall not be wasted
until finally i discover,they have eliminated all,my pencilled outlines
it's not in the best interest,of a germ like hiv or you,to kill its host
it`s not the end of the road,it`s the beginning of a new highway,the `highway to a destination called `success
i've taken on his features to survive,and from me to the kid spotlights,have furnished only wastelands

i have locked myself in here,why don't i go out there,don't i hold my freedom dear
so i sneak out clandestinely,to make my first move towards my family,but what i see is the absence of love compassion warmth and humility
i found out my way through somehow,and came across a blood-soaked dove,she said this is the worth of peace my love
strangulated i return back to my prison,because i find no reason,to live freely in a world full of treason
on my journey ahead,for more frightening will face me: the thought filled me with dread,though my hunger for knowledge
you give me an apartment full of morning smells toasted bagel and black,coffee and the freckled lilies in the vase on the windowsill,you give me -across
you give me midnight apples in a car with the windows down,you give me the flashbulbs of an electrical storm,you give me thunder and the suddenly green underbellies of clouds
you give me hyacinths and narcissus,you give me foxgloves,and soft fists of peony
farewell,to,- nelson mandela

painting the glow,in the green of forest,unseen fingers
snowing,through the blizzard,particles of me
drinking my tea,without sugar,no difference
looking over my shoulder,my behind was covered,with cherry blossoms
i slapped the mosquito,and missed,what made me do that
reading haiku,i am unhappy,longing for the nameless
a frog floating,in the drugstore jar,summer rain on grey pavements
on the porch,in my shorts,auto lights in the rain
another year,has past-the world,is no different
the first thing i looked for,in my old garden was,the cherry tree
my old desk,the first thing i looked for,in my house
my early journal,the first thing i found,in my old desk
my mother's ghost,the first thing i found,in the living room
i quit shaving,but the eyes that glanced at me,remained in the mirror
the madman,emerges from the movies,the street at lunchtime
cities of boys,are in their graves,and in this town
lying on my side,in the void,the breath in my nose

the moon over the roof,worms in the garden,i rent this house

did you cut your hair after your sister's funeral,was it self-flagellation,did you chastise your braids
hey indian boy why did you slice off your braids,was it a violent act,did you despise your braids

i sit taller,daring to stare back into slate blue eyes,that see only color and shapes
angrily i shout at the anger that is all around,bred in anger,kicking and screaming to hell we seem bound

in their green and yellow dress,home they came in white body bags,in heavy coffins with name tags
but many resented the pogrom,people watched in horror,the roundup they cried silently behind their curtains

they'll leave their room a mess,and give cleaning it a miss,but yes i must confess to also doing this
they think their folks are ancient and utterly unfair,the result is to ignore them,before they start to swear
their music cracks the ceiling and makes their parents fume,emotions always reeling,and spend more time in their room
between rendezvous and letter,no eternity passes,only a few days or weeks
i don't owe them anything,love would have said,on this open topic
orators spoke sincere,touche,the light is near
between you and me,tell me or rather,is there a possibility
or plainly ecclesiastical,not to overlook,love underlined
gather your thoughts ma'am,put them away under your hat,where they belong
gather your thoughts ma'am,or you might be the one,who gets locked up
we are children of the almighty,so we are inborn prince or princes,we are not beggar
mum not understanding,papa still musing,plans keep failing do not think suicide
life is a beauty life is a challenge,accept it my dear do not break your family's heart,but go ahead live life full never think of suicide
david of the white rock' the' slumber song' so soft and that,beautiful tune to which roguish words by welsh pit boys,are sung - but never more beautiful than here under the guns' noise

just a few minutes we have shared,on the same trail,for i am just passing through
can't i go back,wait a minute,i mean
no comments clever no boasting wit,just warm arms outreaching,saying take my hand and sit
a beatific smile escapes my lips,conquering all my doubts,and in ecstasy i live knowing
i'm the painter of my world,mystery is a facade of fun,tribulation a conscious cloak
unseen unbounded fathomless fantasies,are i weaving in all planes,master of play and ploy
once a blossoming bud then dying dirt,as a nagging wife and blushing bride,in all i pervade and prevail
i give you all my life,and a gift of love,filled with happiness and peace
come all to church good people,oh noisy bells be dumb,i hear you i will come
the first risen,are now first likely to fall,dead in the street
the day was great,and the sun was burning,slowly night fell
what happened next,how do i tell,i think i was lost and
what we want to tell him,he hears well enough but muffles with a cough,and waves aside
vou sacrificar-me,e logo na inutilidade de ser serei um glorioso ser,de aplicar desterros e fachadas negras
since our lights were extinguished,i have been searching for a way to see,my eyes are lost god knows where
be patient a flash of lightning will come,from another horizon like the white hand,of moses with my eyes my lost diamonds
two decades and a half of marriage,it does not really seem as long,of youth's ebullient song
stars trip down into,the air to enjoy,the sweet bliss
mighty swords go,blunt to make the day,merrier than a tulip's kiss
hope your prince,charming gets a,rocking life abord
where the only sound is greed,and the only clock is light,and pillars of ivory marble glow
your carved grey smile fractures,my curved white hands falter,but tourists don't like tears
he killed his wife at night,he had tried once or twice in the daylight,but she refused to die
in darkness the deed was done,not crudely with a hammer-hard gun,or strangler's black kid gloves on
she just ceased being alive,not there to interfere or connive,linger leave or arrive
it seemed almost as though,her death was quite normal and no,clue to his part would show
and all night all night he enjoyed her,such sport in her smooth dimpled water,then daylight came like a warder
and he rose and went down to the larder,where the mouse-trap again had caught a,piece of stale gorgonzola
i can see the world out yonder,it looks to be,pretty big
not at all what the books say,it's not a movie,there's no script
no one ever thought it would be this way,so whatever we'll be starting today,we better get it started our way
i think i would die out on my own,cause i don't know what else to do,without you
she must grant us flowing words sleepless,as lovers are and a fuller cup and bolder life and,holy remembrance as well to stay wakeful at night
he looked at me bestowing beauty,and i took it for my own,happy i swallowed a star
eve from a rib venus from sea foam,minerva from the head of jove,were much more real
he lowered his head down to my ear: stalwart lover,are you asleep,he whispered disappointedly
terrified,because i daren't go the way she went,yet
i kneel once more,in case mercy should come,in the nick of time
stupid shifty small and sly,peeping through a slit of sty,squinting through their neighbours' plackets
the zen of life is in your parted lips,o you demonstrate the zen of smoking,and my desires are in the ocean of your clothes
fabulous women who,close your doors still,still soaked in night dream on
what is a woman that you forsake her,and the hearth-fire and the home-acre,to go with the old grey widow-maker
she has no house to lay a guest in,but one chill bed for all to rest in,that the pale suns and the stray bergs nest in
she has no strong white arms to fold you,but the ten-times-fingering weed to hold you,out on the rocks where the tide has rolled you
you forget our mirth and talk at the tables,the kine in the shed and the horse in the stables,to pitch her sides and go over her cables
then you drive out where the storm-clouds swallow,and the sound of your oar-blades falling hollow,as all we have left through the months to follow
ah what is woman that you forsake her,and the hearth-fire and the home-acre,to go with the old grey widow maker
at the endless beauty of her brown skin,she should be compared to nature,brown hills mountains fertile valleys dewy grass wind and clear water
indian men are horses smelling wild and gamey,when the indian man,unbuttons his pants the white woman should think of topsoil
there must be one murder one suicide one attempted rape,alcohol should be consumed,cars must be driven at high speeds
and obviously from horse cultures,if the interior indian is male,then he must be a warrior especially if he is inside a white man
if the interior indian is female then she must be a healer especially if she is inside,a white woman,sometimes there are complications
for this we need children,a white child and an indian child gender,not important should express deep affection in a childlike way
somewhere between the sayable and the unsayable poetry runs,antidote to the river,of forgetting
at least i think,because i haven't been there,yet
what if the powers that be,turn up their noses,no good no good
i think,i'll keep writing poems,no one will read
i've been eating,like a sultan,since i was two days old
i had a mother,and three sisters,who worshipped me
set the vision,and start the mission,to set the world into motion
backyard,sweet memories,unbarred
far in the north where the dark-eyed neva river,spills its cold waters and a june day has no end,the city of my childhood sprang up on the marsh
i hear clatter of horses' hooves and see a bronze horseman,traversing each night the broad prospects and vast plazas,with one leap overcoming the chasm under the drawbridge
i pass by elegant french-style houses and gardens,the riches of the age of the tsars added to their brilliance their proud beauty,the old capital of the empire never surrendered never knelt down
nbsp,who knew time would change so many things,life nbsp people things destiny
nbsp,afterwards,we lead lives of our own
so frigil never mobbed by a racket,blazing eyes dreams of soaring heights,little feet wrapped in longing sheets
skin of pearl hair of wonderous curls,a needy face,an innocent grace
a water a psalm,no arrogant steps,just the innocence in every step
what inspired you to [tape damaged,a dog that'd just been neutered,he'd pay a quarter [tape damaged] shakin' wildly like one of them guys with that disease you know ahh

~for kiah and kirstenthat's how things are for mothers,when they are alone when their sonsand daughters have moved beyondthe decades of her touch braided hairand braces lunch sacks and her ever-present shadow inseparable from theirown,nbsp everywhere they go only a mothermust learn to weave her way back homeand stay put and not interfere
who is he who becomes statue like forlorn numbed,on seeing trickling tears in the eyes of motherhood,and feeling the gusts of air changing their direction
the children are at the loom of another world,their braids are oiled and black their dresses bright,their assorted heights would make a melodious chime
they watch their flickering knots like television,as the garden of islam grows the bench will be raised,then they will lace the dark-rose veins of the tree-tops
the carpet will travel in the merchant's truck,it will be spread by the servants of the mosque,deep and soft it will give when heaped with prayer
the children are hard at work in the school of days,from their fingers the colours of all-that-will-be fly,and freeze into the frame of all-that-was
once positioned on their lips,even the scariest of words,come out as a melodious lisp
all day long all through the night,all affairs yours ours theirs,are political affairs
whatever you say reverberates,whatever you don't say speaks for itself,so either way you're talking politics
even when you take to the woods,you're taking political steps,on political grounds
but alas imagine no more for such children exist,children as old as you,children even younger than you
all my gifts under the tree,don't know what to give,i'll give him my heart
good is gifts under the tree,better is good food to eat,best of all a baby savior's birthday
green and red,balls silver and gold,hung on christmas eve
candy to eat,a toy to play with,the joy of a stocking filled
then it stopped retreating into the darkness,as if it wanted,a clear overview of its fate
december o december,let us forget taxes and woes,as we unwrap ribbons and bows
a wreath with a bright red bow,decorations in evey room,bringing christmas cheer to all
bringing folks together,sharing joy and love,hollie is one for the door
happy times return,the winter with its chill,snow mist fog and rain
the trees dress snow-white,spruce fir pine don bells and lights,baubles tinsels star
cantatas and hymns,carols noels and melody,wake up silent night

wine drinks decoctions,soups stews broths mousse and puddings,sweet sour all for you
celestial winds,blow chilled screams for love's mercy,down canyons of dread
machine guns fire knives,that slice the world's bloody tears,like bits of strange fruit
stuff the mailboxes and night repositories,against my attempts to insert,flat evidence of my belonging here
my climate's not suitable for growing,the fruit expected of your tree,and i see you have no patience for experiment
i've misunderstood great men in useful ways,in the natural course of an alien life,so why would i quarrel with locked doors
con las justas pinceladas,quede el lienzo terminado,y eligiendo un marco apropiado
soft this explosion,from alpha to omega,sizzling our names raw
addicted to bliss,dark heaven floods the soul,bright with miracles
from you i'll ask,but won't expect,that miracle
now go meet your deadline,go gather your wheat,but most of all have fun accomplishing this feat
grows on its own,doesn't require our attention,and it becomes the whole bush of it

she bows her head in recognition of their beauty whispering her confusion,willing them to know wanting them near at this time as the night enfolds with the man offering his soft touches and caresses,the tiny gestures she has no memories of
the waning moon a witness to her turmoil,she feels his hand softly tingle down her back she turns to the man finds him smiling intense eyes questioning her solitude,the passion runs through her like the current of the high tide whetting her desire for the closeness of him
she holds out her arms to embrace him her dream becomes reality focussing on his lovely face,she draws the man of pleasures closer drawing all of him to her melting into one moment of eternity,she knows there is only the now of this instant and then there is only solitude with the beauty of him lingering throughout her perfection
she,and must no beautiful woman be,learned like a man
she,i have heard said,there is great danger in the body
he,did god in portioning wine and bread,give man his thought or his mere body
i danced and the stars moved with me,the ground lept beneath my bare feet,i was exalted by the silvery moonlight  and the air was crisp cool and sweet
one night i sat beauty down on my lap,and i found her galling,and i roughed her up
you'll always be a hyena etc,yells the devil who'd crowned me with such pretty poppies,deserve death with all your appetites your selfishness and all the capital sins
ah,i've been through too much:-but sweet satan i beg of you a less blazing eye,and while waiting for the new little cowardly gestures yet to come since you like an absence of descriptive or didactic skills in a writer let me rip out these few ghastly pages from my notebook of the damned
because non shall be spared,i'll change that friendly look,with a kiss of my cold steer
esta es mi muerte,y en ella desdichado de mi,contraigo la enfermedad sagrada

scents of fear fill the street,sweat trickles in the heat,a scream a trip  fall
bold lawman answers call,gently he takes her arm,i'll keep you safe from harm
in a bar,where no one knows,who you are
look at the sky of the fragrant freshness inhale deep the spirit of life,through the half-opened window tender rays paint your hair golden shine from the cages sing the birds the melody of morning let me kiss you a good morning and whisper on your ears the prayers for you for a day,life goes on from charming mornings to weary evenings
on the rainy nights look at the skies heavy of darkness you may find stars twinkling brightness,my dear they are my eyes looking at you to see you growing with all my love to fulfill the dreams i abandoned here to see you carry the traces of this life lived futile,wake up to another morning cherishing the night and walk unto the path through eternity
so delicate and frigil,wavy locks mighty thoughts,lips that beat the rain swept land
knowing themselves too well in one another,their gifts no pure fruition but a thorn,the prick filed sharp against a hint of scorn
dulce ridens dulce loquens,she shaves her legs until they gleam,like petrified mammoth-tusk
our blight has been our sinecure,mere talent was enough for us,glitter in fragments and rough drafts
droplets fall atop our necks,the bakers grim the farmers grin,the birds aloft the winds soar off
her voice soft and sonorous a fresh timbre angelic,a discreet smile she did redeem as a reaction cyclic,and her blanched hand i kissed with devoutness
oh,the first flowers how their scent liberates perfumes,and the first sounds they emit akin to charming murmur
trembling breathless,our mother tries to rise on stork-thin legs,her face confused wasting into shadow
our fierce warrior is dying,her voice falls down and down,we hold her upright wishing she could fly

he himself must be,the key now to the next door,the next terrors of freedom and joy
when a man knows another man,is looking for him,he doesn't hide
he puts on a clean shirt and a dark suit,and goes to the barber shop,to let another man shave him
he shuts his eyes,remembers himself as a boy,lying naked on a rock by the water
fictional vista,lulls us with fleeting solace,and euphoria's blue waves
but when the day dies,we're consumed by fire of facts,and by its million facets
lights come on my eyes open,keep breathing he says,i still feel frozen
until death rode the winds like a brass knocker and begged for attention,of course the birds had cried themselves hoarse,frogs had croaked non-stop
and now the house was up for sale,the theatre group didn't want it,wanted only the money
not the sentimental shroud of an old man,not the front porch that reached out to strangers like a handshake,not the sunlight that fell just short of good feng shui
i live yet do not live in me,am waiting as my life goes by,and die because i do not die
but each man carries to his grave,the kisses that in hopes to save,the angel or his mother gave
if i should sleep with a lady called death,get another man with firmer lips,to take your new mouth in his teeth
yet even as i ponder all at stake,i sometimes really wish,the earth would quake
i am parched now and my tongue is horrible in my mouth,but my brain is noisy,with the clash and gurgle of filling wine-cups

what they see is transmitted,to god's control room,which is beyond our understanding
i want to be a bee digging into an onion heart,as you did to me dug and squatted,long after death and its fang
with a voice less loud though its,joys and fears show wool in dissembled,colours shine
it was on a day in spring,to find my way i had to travel long,in that unknown land
yet a million thoughts racing in every second ahead,i look across the lawn small shoes and tidy dress,seems so perfect on my friends
mysteriously she growl licking my face with her damp tongue holding tightly tightly to avoid any asunder,on top of my bed stands billy the bitch get of me,i strike like thunder
i might be able to fidn the dream road by spontaneously walking,to meet the new day with flaming eyes,instead of the flame of a burnt-out cigarette
one that leads to adversity by others but contentment for ones soul,and the other way round is just to prove self in front of others at the cost of self aspirations,at last the question remains

spring has arrived,all the children's faces,smiling and alive
the light trying to leap from his bones,and continue living unafraid unearthed,by age
standing in the hushed twilight before frogs begin to sing i listen to the last ship's bell signal the wane of day,my exuberant heart beats as to leap from my chest,i wait in the crystal moonlight that reunites family so we may go as one in search of the glorious future that awaits father and son
the intersection so that little girl who passes every day,with her yellow hair ties will look up and think of the moon,or of flowers
go back home go,before it's very late,spend time together

then he shed all his things,slowly and steadily,removing all the physical rings
ha,hunger and thirst,i do not need you
i have to work and slave,because of you,be gone
but,but i ensure that,your body is nourished
i only know that,you have made me miserable,when i don't satisfy you
we have in our hands,the seeds of all you have thrown,without a stance
as i was flying,admiring my flight and,regretting his lack of wings
even if you aren't with me,i may not miss,but hardly waiting for first kiss
which is why death never ends,the game like a hawk chasing a crow,chased off by crows
like a god with huge blue eyes and limbs of snow,the sea and sky lure to the marble terraces,the throng of roses young and strong
some actions do not change the world,and some are more dangerous than,we could possibly fathom
today,tomorrow,what time is now

only one letter,so you start your path by a blank page,clear
a photograph on the desk,it tells tales of youths travels from place to place in time,of lessons learned the hard way
choices left,wars occurred that took our dreams away left us all alone,a time in the past
we finally saw the light in the window,it only took a lifetime to hear the answers and see the truth,a time in the past
we are children without gifts,and christmas morning was pre-empted,by the state of the union address
that makes me so alone,one that no longer cares for the others in need,where people are discarded
a world so different,i know a world that has made me untouchable,that turns its back on those like me

i was an open man of the open streets  a burnished sieve of common purpose  scrawled on walls thrashed cans and blasted caps for equivalence,i wasn't alone  the boulevards teemed with wiggly kids and mooing parents slow as boulders,in the plaza palabra on a green iron bench a grand senora suffered the odes of schoolboys and thugs  smiled behind an opal fan while they searched for words to match their tumultuous nights  and all words fit

and i'd like to get naked and into bed and be hot radiating heat from the inside these sweaters and fleeceys do nothing to keep out the out or keep my vitals in some drafty body i've got leaking in and out in all directions i'd like to get naked into bed but hot on this early winter afternoon already dusky grim and not think of all the ways i've gone about the world and shown myself a fool shame poking holes in my thinned carapace practically lacy and woefully feminine i'd like to get naked into bed and feel if not hot then weightless as i once was in the sensory deprivation tank in madison wisconsin circa i paid money for that perfectly body-temperatured silent pitch dark tank to do what,play dead and not die,that was before email before children before i knew anything more than the deaths of a few loved ones which were poisoned nuts of swallowed grief but nothing of life of life giving which cuts open the self bursting busted unsolvable i'd like to get naked into the bed of my life but hot hot my little flicker-self trumped up somehow blind and deaf to all the dampening misery of my friends' woe-oh-ohs and i'd like a little flashlight to write poems with this lousy day not this poem i'm writing under the mostly flat blaze of bulb but a poem written with the light itself a tiny fleeting love poem to life hot hot hot a poem that would say oh look here a bright spot of life oh look another
my little baby who i will name a weaver of spools and not of dreams with mortal limbs not quite sinew not quite bone paddles a rowboat inside of me and i stay in those moments ever-so-still so that she may reach out to me,the midwife says that what i'm feeling is called quickening,scientists say that she is dreaming practicing for this life i like to think where in her nursery there will be a machine projecting fake moonbeams and fake stars and fake shadows and fake birds and fake clouds to storm over her

we walked on the bridge over the chicago riverfor what turned out to be the last time and i ate cotton candy that sugary air that sweet blue light spun out of nothingness,it was just a moment really nothing more but i remember marveling at the sturdy cablesof the bridge that held us upand threading my fingers through the longand slender fingers of my grandfather an old man from the old worldwho long ago disappeared into the nether regions,and i remember that eight-year-old boywho had tasted the sweetness of air which still clings to my mouthand disappears when i breathe

i saw once in a rose garden a remarkable statue of the roman she-wolf and her twins a reproduction of an ancient statue not the famous bronze statue so often copied in which the blunt head swings forward toward the viewer like a sad battering ram but an even older statue of provenance less clear,the wolf had been cut out of black stone made blacker by the garden's shadows and she stood in profile her elegant head pointed toward something far beyond her her long unmarked body and legs narrower and more finely-boned than the body and legs of wolves as we know them possessed it seemed of a great stillness like the saturated stillness of the roses but tightly-nerved set on the instant to move,under her belly stood the boys under her black breasts not babes as one might expect but two lean boys cut from the same shadowed stone as the wolf but disproportionately small grown boys no bigger than starlings though still like the wolf oddly fine of face and limb one boy pressing four fingers again one long breast his other cupped beneath it to catch the falling milk the second boy wrapping both arms around another breast as if to carry it off neither boy suckling both instead turned toward you dreamy sweetly sly as if to chide you for interrupting their feeding or as if they were plotting a good trick
beautiful those boys among the roses,beautiful the black wolf,but it was the breasts that held the eye a double row of four black breasts eight smooth breasts each narrowing to a strict point piercing sharp exactly the shape of the ivory tooth of the shark

twas my custom to stroll by a clear winding stream with my boots full of dew from the lush meadow green near a neck of the woods where the mountain holds sway without danger or fear at the dawn of the day,the sight of lough graney would dazzle my eyes as the countryside sparkled beneath the blue skies uplifting to see how the mountains were stacked each head peeping over a neighbouring back,it would lighten the heart be it listless with age enfeebled by folly or cardiac rage your wherewithal racked by financial disease to perceive through a gap in the wood full of treesa squadron of ducks in a shimmering bay escorting the swan on her elegant way the trout on the rise with its mouth to the light while the perch swims below like a speckledy sprite and the billows of blue become foam as they breakwith a thunderous crash on the shores of the lake and the birds in the trees whistle bird-songs galore the deer gallop lightly through woods dark as yore where trumpeting huntsmen and hounds of the huntchase the shadow of reynard who leads from the front
so i always know where i can place himwhen i want him at one with himself at ease:there in the mortgaged half-light,there where pinches of vagrant sawdustcan collect in his cuffs and every doorframewelcomes his sidelong blue shadow,anywhere his dimming form can drift at willfrom room to room while dinner's going cold a perfect stranger an auditioning ghost
we shouldn't worship suffering: the world'sa spinning rack where suffering indicatesall goes well we're alive and not curledup in the black hushhush death dictatesas its first condition: no screaming there,we crown ourselves with thorns of pasttransgressions sharp spears of deed spareno rib of pain: around the cross crashedcommon lightning usual blood who earnsour reverence should break both cross and crutchin the face of suffering: while the rack turns,and tightens they'll smile at the sense of touchsuffering's too common to be worthanything joy too rare to be pricedthe saints we search for will embrace the earth:what wild-eyed murderer suffers less than christ
i miss the tilt and racket of your face the collapsing factories of your anger the shoreline wearing your boas of foam the steel mirror of your silence your glass contingencies in the night's hold,i miss the morning's coverlet of cloud one gull flying east over the moving distanceswhile closer inthe same boulder is kissed again and again,as the blacksmith plunges the bruised steel into the tub erasing the heat of his industry i have cooled my browwith the ice of your disdain i have held your cold hand in the rain
gloomy and bare the organ-loft bent-backed and blind the organist,from rafters looming shadowy from the pipes' tuneful company drifted together drowsily innumerable formless dim the ghosts of long-dead melodies of anthems stately thunderous of kyries shrill and tremulous:in melancholy drowsy-sweetthey huddled there in harmony,like bats at noontide rafter-hung

cold comes from every corner,it's snowing,and from the train europe looks likea brittle romantic poemin which the lakes closetheir black moon-lost eyes and tricklingroses can be lying on the groundaround a perfectly ordinary housecontaining a perfectly ordinary familyand then suddenly seep outlike blood througha snow-white bandage
he writes it down,heaven steadiesand concentrates near the lavender,he's already there
i know it will be quiet when you come:no wind the water breathing steadily a light like ghost of silver on the sea and the surf dreamily fingering his drum,twilight will drift in large and leave me numbwith nearness to the last tranquility and then the slow and languorous tyrannyof orange moon pale night and cricket hum,and suddenly there will be twist of tide a rustling as of thin silk on the sand the tremor of a presence at my side the tremble of a hand upon my hand:and pulses sharp with pain and fires fanned and words that stumble into stars and hide
to think that i should hear that mad thing slidingalong a smoking opal ladder,hear that inevitable deluge of music ridinginto the sun richer now fainter now madder,to think that i should hear and knowthe song that shelley heard and shakespeare long ago

suddenly i saw the cold and rook-delighting heaventhat seemed as though ice burned and was but the more ice and thereupon imagination and heart were drivenso wild that every casual thought of that and thisvanished and left but memories that should be out of seasonwith the hot blood of youth of love crossed long ago and i took all the blame out of all sense and reason until i cried and trembled and rocked to and fro riddled with light,ah,when the ghost begins to quicken confusion of the death-bed over is it sentout naked on the roads as the books say and strickenby the injustice of the skies for punishment
your troubles shrink not though i feel them lesshere far away than when i tarried near i even smile old smiles with listlessness yet smiles they are not ghastly mockeries mere,a thought too strange to house within my brainhaunting its outer precincts i discern: that i will not show zeal again to learnyour griefs and sharing them renew my pain,it goes like murky bird or buccaneerthat shapes its lawless figure on the main and each new impulse tends to make outfleethe unseemly instinct that had lodgment here yet comrade old can bitterer knowledge bethan that though banned such instinct was in me

substituting one day for the next remaining attempt to emerge from the next gesture skip deity made entirely of language to the next instant justification graveyard like content like everything else like a given epic like another battle dream beach distance another metaphor without preemptive assumptions,we are through and the matter is time is material substance is too many free radicals a consequence for contemporary rethinking but what account accounts indexes rational skips to the next gesture stale regime,i want to believe in conclusion forest in an ascendant transmission but the pain remains the places visited remain a reverse placebo reverses reason that never was because incessant dread snaps cool captures remains doing the same
this strange thing must have creptright out of hell,it resembles a bird's footworn around the cannibal's neck,as you hold it in your hand as you stab with it into a piece of meat it is possible to imagine the rest of the bird:its head which like your fistis large bald beakless and blind
when hidden away in a damp hollow under moldyleaves i come upon a clump of heart-shapesonce red now spiderspit-gray intact but empty still attached to their dead stems families smothered as at pompeii i riseand stretch,i eat one more big ripe loppedhead,red-handed i leave the field

i hid my love when young till icouldn't bear the buzzing of a fly i hid my love to my despitetill i could not bear to look at light:i dare not gaze upon her facebut left her memory in each place where'er i saw a wild flower liei kissed and bade my love good-bye,i met her in the greenest dells where dewdrops pearl the wood bluebells the lost breeze kissed her bright blue eye the bee kissed and went singing by a sunbeam found a passage there a gold chain round her neck so fair as secret as the wild bee's songshe lay there all the summer long,i hid my love in field and towntill e'en the breeze would knock me down the bees seemed singing ballads o'er the fly's bass turned a lion's roar and even silence found a tongue to haunt me all the summer long the riddle nature could not provewas nothing else but secret love
i cannot freeze sound or collapse phantom scaffolding i open one contradiction after another,they call this erotic intelligence or emptiness they abuse the powdery line at once blessed and beautiful and blank as benign limbs where have you gone in your red dress,you have done nothing wrong and you are not condemned naked as a word the body's modifications no matter how infinitesimal are all that is given
the woman the tiger the door the man the choice,riddles are soulless,in them it is never raining
she compared the man to plants to the plants having a nervous aspect and being motionless,the man coming when he had the sense of being delayed in leaving as if being slowed down had made him come and was exciting and it was during the afternoon with people walking around,he was late and had to go somewhere and came with a feeling of delay and retarding rather than out of nervousness
what if to taste and see to notice things to stand each is up against emptinessfor a moment or an eternity images collected in consciousnesslike a tree alone on the horizon is the main reason we're on the planet,the food's here of the first crow to arrive numbers two and three at a safe distance then approaching the hand-created tasteof leftover coconut macaroons,the instant sparks in the earth's awareness

my grandmother kissesas if bombs are bursting in the backyard where mint and jasmine lace their perfumesthrough the kitchen window as if somewhere a body is falling apartand flames are making their way backthrough the intricacies of a young boy's thigh as if to walk out the door your torsowould dance from exit wounds,when my grandmother kisses there would beno flashy smooching no western musicof pursed lips she kisses as if to breatheyou inside her nose pressed to cheekso that your scent is relearnedand your sweat pearls into drops of goldinside her lungs as if while she holds youdeath also is clutching your wrist,my grandmother kisses as if historynever ended as if somewherea body is stillfalling apart

since there is no place large enoughto contain so much happiness you shrug you raise your hands and it flows out of youinto everything you touch,you are not responsible,you take no credit as the night sky takes no creditfor the moon but continues to hold it and share it and in that way be known

as she laughed i was aware of becoming involved in her laughter and being part of it until her teeth were only accidental stars with a talent for squad-drill,i was drawn in by short gasps inhaled at each momentary recovery lost finally in the dark caverns of her throat bruised by the ripple of unseen muscles,an elderly waiter with trembling hands was hurriedly spreading a pink and white checked cloth over the rusty green iron table saying: if the lady and gentleman wish to take their tea in the garden if the lady and gentleman wish to take their tea in the garden
dance dance like a dancing bear cry like a parrot chatter like an ape,let us take the air in a tobacco trance well,and what if she should die some afternoon afternoon grey and smoky evening yellow and rose should die and leave me sitting pen in hand with the smoke coming down above the housetops doubtful for a while not knowing what to feel or if i understand or whether wise or foolish tardy or too soon
what is poetry,is it a mosaicof coloured stones which curiously are wroughtinto a pattern,rather glass that's taughtby patient labor any hue to takeand glowing with a sumptuous splendor makebeauty a thing of awe where sunbeams caught transmuted fall in sheafs of rainbows fraughtwith storied meaning for religion's sake
caliban speaks to stephano and trinculo,be not afeard the isle is full of noises sounds and sweet airs that give delight and hurt not,sometimes a thousand twangling instrumentswill hum about mine ears and sometime voices that if i then had waked after long sleep will make me sleep again: and then in dreaming the clouds methought would open and show richesready to drop upon me that when i waked i cried to dream again

how sleep the brave who sink to restby all their country's wishes blest,when spring with dewy fingers cold returns to deck their hallow'd mold she there shall dress a sweeter sodthan fancy's feet have ever trod,by fairy hands their knell is rung by forms unseen their dirge is sung there honor comes a pilgrim grey to bless the turf that wraps their clay and freedom shall a-while repair to dwell a weeping hermit there
in things of moment on thy self depend nor trust too far thy servant or thy friend:with private views thy friend may promise fair and servants very seldom prove sincere,what can be done with care perform to day dangers unthought-of will attend delay your distant prospects all precarious are and fortune is as fickle as she's fair,nor trivial loss nor trivial gain despise molehills if often heap'd to mountains rise:weigh every small expence and nothing waste farthings long sav'd amount to pounds at last
true love is but a humble low-born thing and hath its food served up in earthen ware it is a thing to walk with hand in hand through the every-dayness of this work-day world baring its tender feet to every roughness yet letting not one heart-beat go astrayfrom beauty's law of plainness and content a simple fire-side thing whose quiet smilecan warm earth's poorest hovel to a home which when our autumn cometh as it must and life in the chill wind shivers bare and leafless shall still be blest with indian-summer youthin bleak november and with thankful heart smile on its ample stores of garnered fruit as full of sunshine to our aged eyesas when it nursed the blossoms of our spring,such is true love which steals into the heartwith feet as silent as the lightsome dawnthat kisses smooth the rough brows of the dark and hath its will through blissful gentleness not like a rocket which with savage glare whirrs suddenly up then bursts and leaves the nightpainfully quivering on the dazed eyes a love that gives and takes that seeth faults not with flaw-seeking eyes like needle-points but loving kindly ever looks them downwith the o'ercoming faith of meek forgiveness a love that shall be new and fresh each hour as is the golden mystery of sunset or the sweet coming of the evening-star alike and yet most unlike every day and seeming ever best and fairest now a love that doth not kneel for what it seeks but faces truth and beauty as their peer showing its worthiness of noble thoughtsby a clear sense of inward nobleness a love that in its object findeth notall grace and beauty and enough to sateits thirst of blessing but in all of goodfound there it sees but heaven-granted typesof good and beauty in the soul of man and traces in the simplest heart that beats a family-likeness to its chosen one that claims of it the rights of brotherhood,for love is blind but with the fleshly eye that so its inner sight may be more clear and outward shows of beauty only soare needful at the first as is a handto guide and to uphold an infant's steps:great spirits need them not their earnest lookpierces the body's mask of thin disguise and beauty ever is to them revealed behind the unshapeliest meanest lump of clay with arms outstretched and eager face ablaze yearning to be but understood and loved

and memory's wick,draws the liquefied,wax of experience up into flame
strange how quiet they are with their presence,so humble in the low song they sing,not expecting that anyone will listen

power,i was the son of a king,hacking the armor from the limbs of the dying
the fire-flames crooned a tiny song,no cold wind stirred the wintry tree,beside their mother's knee
meet you her my wishes,bespeak her to my blisses,and be ye call'd my absent kisses
i wish her beauty,that owes not all his duty,to gaudy tire or glist'ring shoe-ty
something more than,taffeta or tissue can,or rampant feather or rich fan
more than the spoil,of shop or silkworm's toil,or a bought blush or a set smile
a face that's best,by its own beauty drest,and can alone command the rest
a face made up,out of no other shop,than what nature's white hand sets ope
a cheek where youth,and blood with pen of truth,write what the reader sweetly ru'th
a cheek where grows,more than a morning rose,which to no box his being owes
lips where all day,a lover's kiss may play,yet carry nothing thence away
looks that oppress,their richest tires but dress,and clothe their simplest nakedness
eyes that displaces,the neighbour diamond and outfaces,that sunshine by their own sweet graces
tresses that wear,jewels but to declare,how much themselves more precious are

each ruby there,or pearl that dare appear,be its own blush be its own tear
a well-tam'd heart,for whose more noble smart,love may be long choosing a dart
eyes that bestow,full quivers on love's bow,yet pay less arrows than they owe
smiles that can warm,the blood yet teach a charm,that chastity shall take no harm
blushes that bin,the burnish of no sin,nor flames of aught too hot within

fears fond and flight,as the coy bride's when night,first does the longing lover right
tears quickly fled,and vain as those are shed,for a dying maidenhead
days that need borrow,no part of their good morrow,from a forespent night of sorrow
days that in spite,of darkness by the light,of a clear mind are day all night
nights sweet as they,made short by lovers' play,yet long by th' absence of the day
life that dares send,a challenge to his end,and when it comes say welcome friend
sidneian showers,of sweet discourse whose powers,can crown old winter's head with flowers
soft silken hours,open suns shady bowers,bove all nothing within that lours
whate'er delight,can make day's forehead bright,or give down to the wings of night
in her whole frame,have nature all the name,art and ornament the shame
her flattery,picture and poesy,her counsel her own virtue be
i wish her store,of worth may leave her poor,of wishes and i wish no more
tis she and here,lo i unclothe and clear,my wishes' cloudy character
may she enjoy it,whose merit dare apply it,but modesty dares still deny it
such worth as this is,shall fix my flying wishes,and determine them to kisses
let her full glory,my fancies fly before ye,be ye my fictions but her story

the way the sun dissolves the snow's crust,the way in the wind that stirred the light leaves,the oracle that the sibyl wrote was lost
things from me,along my fingertips bare shoots,of days then years unfurl in the cold air

and this confetti on which our history is being written,smaller amp smaller less clear every moment,and subject to endless revision
no,no hunh,no
off the phonepole woodenly,we rise above the wind park,commemorially
time to recount the sparrows of the air,seated alone on an elected stair,i stare as they appear and disappear
tonight the deck supports tremendous quiet,although the twilight is itself a riot,i'm glad i'm staying here not at the hyatt
my pen eye notes watch whiskey glass and hell,all hang together comfortably well,pain is my favorite resort hotel
put them in a little boat called,she who must be obeyed,our little joke
then in the august of my twenty-seventh year,naked except for my seaclogs,i greeted an audience of piers
after my dip i came up covered,in salt and sand: hair tough as an angel's,who could disappoint me now among the so-coifed
camp is over and the children come out,wearing hats the children are happy for each other,each camp having been maximally appropriate
beef: or it reaches the furthest point,the branch turns from us and is for some arc,fully quiet
i need help moving my chickens,i need help with girl problem,my dog like keeps marking the wrong areas
lobster trap elegies,the way a hung coat suggests a general's death,on the banks of the monongahela and dinner guests toreadors
everything birthing its vanishing point,even the sycamore,which is to say even the man is due to be shot skinned and tanned
cooling sheds phrenology,moose racks buckets,the smoothness of a plank box and the irregularity of hay
i think it's very cold there,i think andrew loves,his wife: her posture beneath a flat-crowned hat
a streak of sun climbed the rough,trunk of a tree but he did not,see it with his open eye
the unborns we named,beinn narnain ben vane beinn ime,ben vorlich and beinn bhuidhe
a shadow in the shape of a house,slides out of a house,and loses its shape on the lawn
she'll have got to the mantis eggs by now,at each gulp of hatchling,she slowly blinks with satisfaction
follow where all is,/ follow the transfused,/ follow what is still and what is still-attracting
she pointed out that i had not made eye contact,with her at all,then i cried properly in a short burst
let butter and chocolate be a wish not to die,i implored the bain-marie,she likened me to a sieve
i clutch all my poems to my chest and count them,again and again,i am kneeling like a small dog
how much bigger though,when i say,i've had enough how will you know when to stop
firmer still a melee awkwardness that showed all registrants just,how we managed to pickpocket night,then came dark crowds
some doodled for the pad debriefed what pumiced eyes meant,in multi-dotted foreign rows,buildings like a spider's clothes
modern territories click like a mouse,body becomes human body,on a skinny avenue i hushed up pyramidal steps older than sorcery
picnics bended over they happen below,swings parks rung,i inject chlorine into my memory-parts with lady satisfaction
are you gay,a political campaign sanctioned a quart of moose,so stars soon quarreled back to the travel section of the north
the positional plot warps but is the same,the deluxe mattress drifts,on gravitational subtleties like the rest of us practicing the gut's banjo
no in fact i don't know how he ever crossed the channels or canals,from that stout city,i don't really know if i ever really need to know
a furnace's windup huffing,in this throat,clearing of snow
when pungent or cruel they sauce the ache,light folds them in two,what i want to say is i would meet you upon this
that was the sedgy day invisible contagions,stretching from our roof,on which the fresh trails of spilled pink
i fall in love,the things,the wind is telling me
i fall in love,how they wear,their strange amp double-eyes
i'm in the barricade hearing the clock thickening you,autumn encircles a confusion that's nothing new,flash back to warring eyes almost letting me drown
and i'm in the barricade hearing the clock thickening you,clematis enclosures walking with news pollinated by a,secondary grief while something reminds you of our love
i wish i had left the same way,but i brought with me all my belongings,even my army mug and a bunch of old letters
and how do you survive,your long throat,your red-rag-to-a-bull head
rain fell as a glass,breaks,something suddenly everywhere at the same time
you if no one else,will condemn with your tongue,the erosion each disappointment brings
i see the body with its own career of gestures,its bright roads its dark roads,apart serene
trapped in one chained line,one terrifying combination of arrangements,driven to taste each other's flesh
near the old and lost river they surmised,spanish moss strains coffee pretty good,they sang green green grass of home
they were whingeing stuck in lodi,forty slavonians in the big thicket,they sang ne me quitte pas beneath mesquite
a dollar is peeled off a roll of thousands,it is the day the mint of it is in my mouth,i open it completely fresh
when you put down the book you will come when you,hear the words put down the book,you will come when you hear
which of you knows how not to part the pebble on the beach from its colors,the songbird from its social network,the fruit from its multifaceted peel
and each seed-bearing fruit has an atmosphere,each has its several moons,has tides  changing weather lunar eclipses
truly: all hells and hierarchies are works of the imagination,and equally,it is not the part of the daoist sage to conjure meaningless hells
silver bag of  herself,with turquoise gilt,midriff
greeks pictured the afterlife,as an insipid version,of the world they knew
the subject will claim,that she has been taken,to the wrong place
that the room,she is brought back to,is not the room she left
if you mock us pan,in whom we also believe do it,as gently as you can
i had the happy idea that someday i would find both pleasure and punishment that i would,know them and feel them,and that until i did it would be almost as good to pretend
i had the happy idea that what i do not understand is more real than what i do,and then the happier idea to buckle myself,into two blue velvet shoes
and clicked each lucky one,and one,until i was happily undone
you have a smooth and upturned chin,cold cheeks unbruisable eyes,and hair as grooved as fig skin
still bride of your own armor,bride of your own blind eyes,this isn't an appeal
resumed,some nights i paint into the scene two doves,i being alternately one and then the other calling myself by my kind
and the wool was pulled,over as cover,no eyes were kept peeled
and when he learned the truth about her tongue,he downed the bead: her true form a nine-tailed,fox who could have turned human had he kissed on
whatever party fame's doing to her,chances for a quick trial,barbarella can't touch her goldilocks
i wish she could have a single day of  language,so that i might reassure her don't be afraid,our whole world is dead and so can do you no harm
fell to the bottom of fathoms became black,slick hid in shale,they drill down miles
some music   some shelling,will strike our dead    who flew off in the early raids,have you seen them   return from their flying
the heat compounded and ugliness,settled its cloud over us profound as human speech,although by then we were not speaking
and i hear the crows complaint complaint,splitting the morning hunched over the skull,they know their offices
grown-ups keep their feet on the ground,when they swing,i hate that
don't talk big to me,i'm carrying my box of faces,if i want to change faces i will
i'll invite a bee to live in your shoe,what if you found your shoe,full of honey
what if the clock said,instead of,would you be scared
in this poem all artifice,is stripped away,but you are held under water
instead of a dog barking there was silence,then the sound of a drum beaten loud amp fast,by a young nun
maybe he could drift through the crush of lookers,in cigarette smoke in the breath of many lungs,common innocuous a cloud about to disappear
in the broad yard,each thing dandles,its blue its name its consequence
i want to travel far amp then return,the wind blows as if i were eighty-five,maybe eighty-seven
and so alone,un-alone even in my anger,bring you here
counting feels just as impossible,as turning solid mountains,into a ditch
i'll shower with you but i'm leaving,my underwear on and you enjoyed her,in every way you could enjoy a person with soap
you didn't join your wife in the shower,she's gotten funny about letting you see her,shave her legs or wash herself anywhere
i know,my big mouth,full of their light
avoid the hive mind,go fly a kite,raise a stained glass window in the sky
in pieces,let me collect its dna,from the tears on your desk
the water's not too cold,it doesn't feel,like being dead
in her focus-wrinkled brow for a living,today,i think i practice the religion of blinking too much
there are many opportunities here for unrequited friendship,the offer letter said,all you need is a chain saw and die grinder
into making us,the thing we want,to call beautiful
my hands feel like scorpion claws,clamped on to a hard hard shovel all day,then curled into fists at night
sorrow's a barbaric art crude as a viking ship or a child,who rode a spotted pony to the lake away from summer,in the s  toward the iron lung of polio
today i bring an actual-size sunrise and many glow words,from the inmates of this late-stage civilization who navigate,in your slipstream and to whom you say keep rowing
ain't no lightness of hand but of bounce player,constraints imposed by a corvid named jim,could not interpret my remedies
jim wasn't much of a macgyver,not one skill in therapeutic thaumaturgy,he prescribed cowlicks for the heartsick: i mean really
t-bone hit it straight for,cause the planets were so aligned,sho'nuf heard these arcane words precise
comes in georgia peach flavor,too much will turn your guts like,entheogen
dare to transpose any other energy drink sookie,this exhumation bears no map,fore the next internment there shall be no other
we will watch the first grader with little cymbals,bending her knees hunched in concentration,while neighbors snicker at her ardent face
we lower its silken ceiling,to graze his dark hair,repeat the prayer
only white people swim in lakes nowadays,you know,crystal lake
abandoned tires relics of its sewer days river herring spark no fear,and a publicly funded park with a biology class a boat-making workshop,for the children of hunt's point gives me hope we'd wet our hair again
a sporty new aged convenience,a luxury to admire when long beach is too far,and rockaway too dirty
till everyone got it off by heart,every start was a bad start,since all conclusions were foregone
every wood had its twist of woodbine,every cliff its herd of fatalistic swine,every runnel was a rubicon
it walks out the door with my legs,through the gate,headed straight for the racetrack
blocks with the waxed blade lifted,and tossed lifted and tossed again,squaring off against the snow
we didn't like each other,but lynn's mother had died,and my father had died
lynn's father didn't know how to talk to her,my mother didn't know how to talk to me,and lynn and i didn't know how to talk either
hit publish and look away,the new violence: i visited a country where,everything looked like home
it had to be from someone who didn't exist,before this poem,began writing itself down
am: the frogs,ask what is it what is it,it is what it is
my mother sends me a black-and-white,photograph of  her and my father circa,posing with two indian men
who are those indian guys,i ask her,on the phone
farther than our hero santiago can see,i rise in the night to find the sharp knife,that came with the pears as a courtesy
five of  them later scarfing the oak's,black bole,laying a dream of snakes
the pause,the lean in,the reveal
yes i live inside the piano,but there is no need for you,to come and visit me
smiling,to cold air i slept under a bear skin,touched your lips in the night
in time we cut through the ice sank,fathoms into the sea chaperoned by seals,that are not mermaids at all
i sing the beauty of bodily touch,with my muse blue grace,spring
coyote girls in myth-time,at the central dream of edenic treasures,the irrevocable annihilation of christian civilization is taking shape with carnivorous flowers of volcanic thought
i thought jack abramoff was my buddy,a small fish with a large chicken,what a dick
doesn't anyone care about my feelings,all i wanted to do was kill little birds,because you know that's fun
goosedown a thistle fluff naked and,hatless unaccounted for and extra,the world like a world like a world
farewell to you my hopes my wonted waking dreams,farewell self-pleasing thoughts which quietness brings forth,and farewell friendship's sacred league uniting minds of worth
you better hope you never see angels on the rez,if you do they'll be marching you off to,zion or oklahoma or some other hell they've mapped out for us
my brothers and sisters were giddy shredding,his stained t-shirts and raggedy pants throwing them up,into the air like confetti
a few stray dogs came to the window,i heard their stomachs and mouths growling,over the mariachi band playing in the bathroom
i brought up the pots and pans and spoons,banged them,together like a new year's day celebration
i seen the troops shoot people,they ride around with guns,almost like we was in a prison camp
no the place wasn't on fire,it was some children upstairs,playing with the fire extinguisher
like hell,and like i said i never in my life grew up in a house,with millions of people
two hours later they drop us water,and half of it burst open,cause they was so high up when they dropped it
the news got us out,not the national guard not the mayor not blanco,the news people is the only ones who got us out
channel got me out,channel,the rest of them was there to kill us
i got tired of convention centers,i wanted,to come the hell up out of that damn convention center
born on monday and a tiny,world-containing grain of light,passed through each eye like heaven through a needle
he rolled on wednesday rolled his whole body,full of immense salt spaces slowly,from one horizon to the other
and on saturday he tested a footstep,and the sky came down and alit on his shoulder,full of various languages in which one bird doesn't answer to another
and on sunday he dreamed he was flying,and his mind grew gold watching the moon,and he began to sing to the brink of speaking
i am watching the movie twelve angry men,because there is a character in it,who reminds me of him
in the forest of  wearisome sadness,where one day i found myself wandering alone,i met my heart who called to me asking me where i was going
it's not just this,every written word is a suicide note,and a love letter too
if you are going there by foot prepare,to get wet,you are not you anymore
while washing dishes with a bleeding hand,there's a line that cleaves things come apart,things join in wholes of which they are a part
not what is your name,but what,the battle
safe from the elements,protected from rust,and more esoteric forms of corrosion
my father gave me a rosewood chess set when i turned twelve,and it probably wasn't love just a lucky last-minute guess,at the toy store which is probably what most love is anyway
and she mortally threatened wholly unaware,that i do this daily alone with the gold last light,in what seems to me an act of love
who are you,the king asks,it is not like that the seer says
the seer leaves the king alone in his throne room,and starts walking to china kicking up gravel,hurrying to find the next king
those flowers i've only heard of,to whatever there is and isn't,above
what kind of delusion are you under,the life he hid just knocked you flat,you see the lightning but not the thunder
what god hath joined let no man put asunder,did god know you'd marry a rat,what kind of delusion are you under
his online persona simply stunned her,as it did you when you started to chat,you see the lightning but not the thunder
to the victors go the plunder,you should crown them with a baseball bat,what kind of delusion are you under
languishing yet at the very,bottom rung letting go my grip,long before the blessing
how we huddled all night in our small house,moving between rooms,emptying pots filled with rain
i want to live there someday across that street,and listen to him,yap yap yap
as the nurse puts my cheek to sleep,and the doctor begins to burn,those summers away
she's with grandma in front,of grandma's house backed,by a willow tree gladiola and roses
no doubt mother frowns,behind the lens wants,to straighten this sassy face
in fact you,couldn't prove,they're not
it is summer,under our butter bread,summer's hunger satisfied
penciled seagull in the margin,following line by line,the path you took i imagine no print so fine
don't call it a failure call it knowledge,the peculiar taste that filled his mouth,as if  he had bitten his cheek
whatever he risked did not matter whatever,he could imagine was already lost,bored the other boy coughed into his hands
evening falls,someone's playing a dulcimer,its voice touches and parts the air of summer
i'm moving from grief street,taxes are high here,though the mortgage's cheap
when i throw them out,it may frighten you,and maybe me too
a new embroidery of flowers canary color,dots the grass already dotty,with aster-white and clover
how deep does that go,how do you know,do you think you're a seer
him anymore,whatever,i'm all like
we did speak like that,as if from a book of psalms,because it took up the sky
no other church  though i don't know its rite,could so from head to epididymis,move me with deep devotion to its site
these are the nights men run,guaymas before midday,a beach-town life
i wear my heart on my sleeve,or rather both sleeves since,it's usually broken
of the mares i will have left only early morning,who won't know that i will soon take her hide,turn it into an ocean that will at last cleave open my skull
well that's memory for you that's so-called,civilization for you to layer up,to redo the already done
something perverse about that,something perfectly fiendishly self-conscious about that,ask
how can you,be in two places at once,when you're not anywhere at all
fine,fuck it,start over
they're not,that smart anyhow a stage-whispering drunk from the back,of our imperial realm mile  the park road
have at it,please explain,please fill in this blank
the spirit leans,intrigued the other part bored then there's want,then there's wait
thus begins the beef between bird and bee,the isthmus isolating,order from chaos
of primped snakes,he thought,but it is the cold weight of scales that protects
and when i tell frances i see she is a moon,motionless in the doorway skin reflecting,a lamp a face that awakens on paper
yet an hour can have shape and proportion,four walls a ceiling,an hour can be dropped like a glass
a chimney swift flits through the fumatorium,i long for one last blue democracy,which has broke my heart a while
goodbye luck you idiot,said the fox to the grapes,i love you replied the grapes
i know that rarity precedes extinction,like that of the purple orchid in my garden,whose sudden disappearance rattled me
jane in her way is also beautiful,and therefore near extinction i suppose,she is certainly rare and fragile of bone
she insists she is dying day by dubious day,and spends her evenings looking at photographs,of her mother who never believed in love
i moved my chair into sun,i sat in the sun,the way hunger is moved when called fasting
she said her vows near the shore where,the emigrants set down their consonantal n,on afternoon on the end of everything at the start of ever
better to marry than to burn,she quotes,she don't know us
in a precisely lighted room the cfo speaks,of start-to-start dependencies,says let me loop back with you
still one table away,these two with gnarled empretzled hands,seem unhappy in the old way
where half the people in your life have gone dissolving,your sense of time which was never supposed to have,an end
he puts his tools away,one by one lays them out carefully,on the deal table his work done
and this gulf of blues deep and shiny,the only place to be,between time and eternity
what if  it were possible to vanquish,all this shame with a wash of  varnish,instead of wishing the stain would vanish
what if  you gave it a glossy finish,what if  there were a way to burnish,all this foolishness all the anguish
what if  you gave yourself  leave to ravish,all these ravages with famished relish,what if  this were your way to flourish
what if  the self  you love to punish,knavish peevish wolfish sheepish,were all slicked up in something lavish
what would be left if  you couldn't brandish,all the slavishness you've failed to banish,what would you be without this gibberish
what if  the true worth of the varnish,were to replenish your resolve to vanquish,every vain wish before you vanish
again today no miracles at hand,just in the field wrens who stab at milkweed pods,a nuthatch bargaining from its split branch
barred light,dunes coming on,and on
is losing itself,though the trees,are clearly limned
to spirit up my mare,in every shape but those appear,which taste and nature wear
i want only to admire the grass,the great locks of trees,that the idea is enough
who is it that actually sees herself,the heart center of the fragrance,billowing toward its end
and with tears put salt in these mythical tales,and with an arras weavers combe of box she fiercely smit,by sinking level with us l'enfant in the room
thy matchless mercy i implore,when i must wake to sleep no more,in realms of endless being
ca-ca,and we never even had the slightest,clue that che was camping out
a circle,what was needed was a circuit,and a good operating system
what's within is without being seen,to be so,optical anomaly as unexceptional
four left's a square,one way turning system,until it becomes its other way
a passive insistence on multiples,until that divorces itself,becomes single
said well here opens his sits,at its bottom,the bodies
the whey foam on the head,of the safest society in human,civilization
amnesia to people,who will actually,harm and hurt
my father came upon me once cross-legged on the floor,his sad smile telling me more than any detection,he took my hand and closed the door
i throw away my half-finished letters to him in my tiny pink wastebasket but,my aim is no good,the floor is scattered with fire hazards declarations unread
hockey star amp cross-country runner,who sat at my lunch table,in high school
jumped out of a greenwich village window,in,anne kepler
killed by smoke-poisoning while playing,the flute at the yonkers children's hospital,during a fire set by a year old arsonist
may she be refused in both heaven and hell,and wander the earth forever without rest,a hungry ghost clinging to the rocks and trees
it's your own,life you lean over greedy,going back for more
the first one means: repeating or myriad,consisting of many parts increasing in number,happening over and over without end
overnight a wall sprang up around him,leaving the rest of us,outside
that kind of speed keeps a poet accountable,he won't ever say the grass is very green,when it's only green
he lay still for an hour and a half,then reared up onto his rickety legs,like a newborn calf
the anthology of love poems i bought,for a quarter is brittle anyway and comes,apart when i read it
one at a time i throw pages on the fire,and watch smoke make its way up,and out
i put on my blue jacket and join them,the children stand with their mouths,open
all that is beautiful from which i choose,even artifice which i hold above nature,won't salve these stuttered accoutrements
one hand said i will go where you go,while the other hand continued,on alone
outside there's a world where every love scene,begins with a man in a doorway,he walks over to the woman and says open your mouth
the heist gang dons clown masks and,sherry will betray george and johnny can't love fay,and the fortune in the suitcase just blows away
bartender make it straight and make it three,one for the negro,one for you and me
nearer the ground than townsend's solitaire,doctor nkomo,raked his hair
this is just one of the things,i noticed about my thoughts,as they passed easefully by
their clothes no longer fit,it was this that brought them,to me crying their faces twitching
replies the frail,and faithful heart,it's not for sale
last night in bed,i mouthed a prayer,of my own composition
the pen is no mightier than the soul,never underestimate the nib of corruption,better late than suffer the long introduction
we drop the shadows where they are then,return to them,when the light has grown heavy
we've never been too sure that we exist as the earth does,we're most at home in water,that soaks up the letters in our brains
the cool expiring slowly in the high-ceilinged room,while a pinned-up psyops leaflet declares,if you sleep in a cemetery you're bound to have nightmares
a big hard-working hand anybody's,to come medicinally down antibody,to the slow infection of  her western face
but time outbids all comers and we die,expensively in princess margaret,who was herself once so beautiful
approach life as if it were a banquet,your rightful portion averts your ireful potion,caress what can't be blessed cup shadows under breasts
let pass what's out of  ken: lover job riches,a ripe peach,until it reaches you
but had my belief in the fiction not been thus buoyed up,i might in the sigh and strike of the next night's bombs,have realized a little what they meant and for the first time been afraid
sometimes you say something like even so boo,and it sounds like breathe darling,that's why this one's for you
of lightning splits the sky,and a hammer of thunder pounds the earth,and the eagles and panthers cry
only the fort remains near forty feet high,round unfinished half open to the sky,the elements wind rain god's deliberate eye
i began to raise my head and noticed,for the first time the bunting,red white and blue hung out for the parade
would you move just one inch over,there,the light was in my eye
here is the photographer and his party,exploring the great canyons of the west,while their clothes dry on the line
look for me under the hood,of that old chevrolet settled in weeds,at the end of the pasture
i'm the radiator that spent its years,bolted in front of an engine,shoving me forward into the wind
that which made abraham bare the priestly knife,and isaac kneel or that young hebrew girl,who sought her father coming from the strife
soldiers we must fight and save,freedom now and give our foes,all their country should a grave
house,the apple trees have taken over the sky,sequestered the gate sidled over the porch
lit on the table the dried twigs,the autumn leaves in the blue chinese vase,thanks for the faces our faces in this low light
this keeps the focus where it wants to be,on whom you ask,invariably on
i didn't even have to say did i,i love you so much,no need to reply
how my hardscrabble prayer,in it's dove's arc,was answered
where'd you get that voice,refusing to come,to a particular point castration finally made sense
the entries there make no mention of hell,which was sifted through the vale of tears  amp fell,to make earth  amp the base of this hill where i sunbathe amp murmur
shut up be like a compass,the king,has erased your name from the book of speech
i'm done,speak to me soul's soul's soul,from desire of whom from whose desire every throat was cut
toward what we knew and did not know,we knew in the spreading twilight,that returns changed to a changed place
i thought we were playing a game,in a forest that day,i ran as my mother chased me
over the courses i travel from now on,what's that whisper,just the delicate sweeping away of somebody's life
we're dear blood daughters to this every hag and near kin,to any after this of those our mirrors tell us foolishly envy us,presuming us who are young to be beautiful kind and sure
blood from a kitchen fresco in thick amber strokes,blood from the baby's right ear from his ochre nose,what blood is this
it is blood time sir terminator says,it is blood time sir simpson winks,it is blood time sir mcveigh weighs
blood on the wheel blood on the reel,bronze dead gold amp diamond deep,blood be fast
amp all the while we found love in unlikely places: in,the ravaged church of our bodies amp our faces,refracted in their long faces
amp at three he told me at my age he had red hair amp broke his neck falling off,a runaway horse i know,the rocking chair's set too close to the edge of the porch
more than anything,when i speak of,the darkness i mean this living
back then we slept watched tv,we were the dogs,by the time the screen door slammed we were gone
to move the limbs of the body,to speak intelligible words,these things promise change
away so that i could always  hold this concise image,of before  that  time  and it,floods  my memory
they eat of me,of small and blemished apples in low fields of me,whose rocky streams and droughts i do not drink
like a perfume,that does not choose the direction it travels,that cannot be straight or crooked kept out or kept
gauley bridge is a good town for negroes they let us stand around they let us stand,around on the sidewalks if we're black or brown,vanetta's over the trestle and that's our town
the hill makes breathing slow slow breathing after your row the river,and the graveyard's on the hill cold in the springtime blow,the graveyard's up on high and the town is down below
did you ever bury thirty-five men in a place in back of your house,thirty-five tunnel workers the doctors didn't attend,died in the tunnel camps under rocks everywhere world without end
when a man said i feel poorly for any reason any weakness or such,letting up when he couldn't keep going barely,the cap and company come and run him off the job surely
when the blast went off the boss would call out come let's go back,when that heavy loaded blast went white come let's go back,telling us hurry hurry into the falling rocks and muck
as dark as i am when i came out at morning after the tunnel at night,with a white man nobody could have told which man was white,the dust had covered us both and the dust was white
instead i walk around in children's clothes,shorts and a t-shirt with the name of a band,lettered on the front announcing me to nobody
like a boardinghouse table,men on one side women on the other,nobody planned it
a man and a woman are like those rivers,entering a larger sea,greater than the sum of all its parts
in the bathroom crayoned,graffiti,fuck the
stand still and silent,pray,return
with regards to your husband i am as,ever your loving father,frederick douglass
full of light and music the beating air,light like a bird calvino says not a feather,over the water the shags come in to land
though once there were many of my kind,flocking inland or perhaps,it felt that way
then laughs,it's okay kiddo,long as you're here you're one of us
and things: a wishbone ring whatever i crave,the heart-hollows the cannot-do-withouts the whens,and whos the frayed veils between death and here
love,a,minor
i could make a wardrobe,with tufts of wool,caught on thistle and bracken
down in minutes,within the month,an island silted up behind
glove over glove let your dance express,what i've been creeping like a vein of sweat,through a vastness of
hunger,is like the inside,biting you
i don't know when i stopped believing in heaven,or if i do,maybe i just stopped receiving heaven
we married in september,everyone was still,wearing their summer shirts sleeves of heaven
it was white there was a bend and the car,spun,it was then i prayed pleading with heaven
when he goes limp lie him down on the gurney,mom,oxygen mask breathing heaven
he loves the colors of planets,i teach him,their lifelessness: beautiful deceiving heaven
my drawing teacher said: look think make a mark,look i told myself,and waited to be marked
but loss is a precious stone to me a nectar,distilled in time preaching the truth of winter,to the fallen heart that does not cease to fall
mother and father,forgive me my absence,i will always be moving quietly toward you
the old magic won't work now,but it's nice,to be reminded of it

walk naked before me,carrying a sheaf of sticks,it's the most honest thing a man can do
cynomyopsis cadavarena,on every tongue,they feed
i'm not in with this mystery,somebody steady me,cool ocean breezes don't make me laugh
i'm in with noisy metal little nils,a million apologies,i must have made more
this is cruising,at watch-me,miles-an-hour
a crow gliding over a ravine was,the sign his eyes were waiting for,they thought they were ready to cross
for years i have been here without a clear map,that hopes should dim as days go on above is,natural i suppose what do i know
i am dressed like one of them,the thick walls quake but stay soundproof,i fear my fists vestigial
all shapes breaking hysterical particles and subs who settled,devoting former whir of shape to silence,which was enough
it stayed uniform silent for some many months,which strengthened to pull outer space noise in to neutralize,but lost its grip
so this sound hard-pressed in to sink holes,and look into original force that was still shut in,under black lacquer cabinetry: our future perfect world
it opened the door of dust,the space sound picked up pings distantly,seeing to sound is what and how bounceback
since the dust so still and small,the waves skinnied high-pitched,to switch on resistance of an average mote
what would stand to receive,what was the point of pointing out resisting decay,what was there to say
so sound deranged to be,needle pierce to dust piece,and sunned a word heard first by the bygone
and the silence startled by the sneaking sound,forgot its own high ground,and grumbled some rebuke
we wondered what our walk should mean,taking that un-march quietly,the sun stared at our signs thou shalt not kill
men by a tavern said those foreigners,to a woman with a fur who turned away,like an elevator going down their look at us
along a curb their signs lined across,a picket line stopped and stared,the whole width of the street at ours: unfair
insomniac monkey-mind ponders the dove,symbol not only of peace but sexual,love the couple nestled and brooding
monkey-mind envies the male dove,who equally with the female secretes,pigeon milk for the young from his throat
for peace send all human males between,fourteen and twenty-five to school,on the moon or better yet mars
is peace merely a vacuum the negative,of creation or the absence of war,the teaching says peace is a positive energy
still something in me resists that sweet milk,my mind resembles my restless inferior cousin,who fires his shit in handfuls from his cage
that takes and takes and never fills,i kick,stroke my tired arms to buoy this body
not ever,want picks the human heart,you're the lie i won't believe forever
i broke my left wing in the revolution,when troops were sent to vandalize the chapel,they hit me once almost apologetically
of boys who knew no better,way to grow up than throw up,the crown amp be down for whatever
silent resonances of glass configured,had i but struck us off the masque of blackness,as it was playing
like a hand brushed across the bill of a cap,let this be the sign,i'm getting a grip on the sacrifice
here we are left with,the stairway that separates my,i am not at the mercy of men  oceans
between one airplane and,their innocence wanes under,the word has sunk   silence to us is forbidden
one or another nightmare may come true,and what to do then,what in the world to do
and so now i'm sitting in a dimly lit,where the windows are covered with soot,and the coffee is warm and bitter
so full,of longing for the world,changes its shape
a vigilant gun that always picks out,the right target even if it's you,no matter who you're aiming at
a truck so awesome only the president,of the united states of america's allowed,to careen in it to his own beat
all the greatest hits from the last millennium,performed live on stage on the inside,of your state of the art acoustically-enhanced skull
a complete set of nude photos,of you taken by you and sold,back to you at a discount
rain water in a bottle sunshine in a box,and ambience sounds from a bus stop,down the street recorded on a cd
a baseball game that never ends,to be played simultaneously with,a football game that never ends
landmines made with dough,topped with mozzarella and all,your favorite toppings
and i did,i liked it so much that now we're,getting married
i love you for your holes she said,not just the holes in your shoes and socks but the,gaping holes in your personality
i have never been fishing on the susquehanna,or on any river for that matter,to be perfectly honest
not in july or any month,have i had the pleasure if it is a pleasure,of fishing on the susquehanna
sitting in a small green,flat-bottom boat,holding the thin whip of a pole
that is something i am unlikely,ever to do i remember,saying to myself and the person next to me
a philosopher did not realize that the man who expelled poetry from,well-ordered republics used to tremble at the thought of doing so,thereby creating through that very act a sublime poetry
los muchos que el tirano amor me debe,y en mi cabello anticipar la nieve,por quien el apetito se le atreve
mas consolarse quiere mi disgusto,que es el deseo del remedio indicio,y el remedio de amor querer vencelle
cuando me paro a contemplar mi estado,que la mayor mal pudiera haber llegado,ver acabar conmigo mi cuidado
an entire landscape in antarctica disappears evaporates until salt becomes the only debris,there are keys to everything even handcuffs,you could have been happy too
but i covered my face and wept,for ashes are not beautiful,even in the dawn
but still i walked on,in the drowning rain,slowly winding up the string
i seek him for atonement of my sin,this day of fasting to forgive the wrong,and he will answer he will say forgiven
when the loons cry,the night seems blacker,the water deeper
across the shore,an eyelash-charcoal,fringe of pine trees
they pack their bags and take the train,and travel through a strange terrain,but not to where the castle is
we wakeful ah pity us,we that go back with policeman day,back from the city of sleep
of your body) pleasured corners of a place,in which the difficult new breathing,and i are foreigners
let it be to gain all it can in one fetter,but if it be life,let it attempt a failed recognition
let its thinker be the failure,my thinker is failure,and i want to teach it how to move in this world
tonight i stitch,the breeze off the bay smells of aria,it is almost the season for cloaks
which is to say the only private one sole unrevealed,opaque,center of his universal panopticon
ready to receive remains built for death ready to receive the flatly desolate superficial deeply commissioned intellectual offer of suggestive actions for the hunger assassin to fall back on and become forcefull psychological damage bottled for drinkable agitation,riding a back seat writing construction contesting the oncoming molten universe immersed in villagers city dwellers trembling laughing  to inhale flesh and stone from long ago forgetting the horrors of holy oil infusion clocks and gritty body galleries leaving behind the mourning river's crimson fragrance smoldering from the previous unbearable fever,in a posture of myself on a speeding body without hands and feet i am ready to receive the vomit of consciousness and proceed down the avenues of suggestion to become a limited option
an owl out on the marsh,by november,it will be nailed through the breast to the barn
the great man's gratitude to his best friend,kings' promises whores' vows towards thee may bend,flow swiftly into thee and in thee ever end
then the page someone folded to mark her place,then the page on which nothing happens,the page after this page
arcing the thin golden,stream amp singing,ooo-ee ooo-ee at our ruin
absorbed now in the dream of skin on skin,he whispered the profound,and destined promises she'd never share
you're to be watched by three fowl commonplace in florida,even these,three hearty objectionables: the blue tit the woodpecker and the swampcunt

this ends in darkness,amp all the stars within reach,amp other constellations
i agree to meet you at the ferry heading to a place,neither of us wants to go but both just said,sure i'll go
the sun came out,it was the old sun,with only a few billion years left to shine
the last line should strike like a lover's complaint,you should never see it coming,and you should never hear the end of it
when i think about the fact,i am not thinking about you,it is a new way of thinking about you
blowfish arranged on a saucer,russian roulette,angelic slivers
ginseng,cut antlers allotted in bags dogs on a spit a dutch girl,winking holds a bowl of shellfish
you can stand at the doorway,quarrelling with your legs to enter,or run until you turn to ash
i want to say harder,i can take it but,there's no proof i can
fish detaching from its canvas of silk,or rice paper a,swirl of color motion swimming away
i want the image even when i am it or nearly it,because even then i am also that other thing,self-conscious burdened struggling for movement
what do we do when we hate our bodies,a good coat helps,some know how to pull off a hat
we say is another mirror,a depth a conjure in which we might meet,someone who says touch me
maybe it's unfair,a possum entering,the argument here
by our brutal beautiful,and very pleased,little dog
thinking how different,in our adversaries,we are from possums
we try love,the fist of words,their opening hand
so call me if,you call me mrs,vogelsang

pyke from his massachusetts madhouse,envisioned it,as a divine craft an ark impervious to torpedoes
into berlin in boxes marked officers only,on the grounds,that the germans were an obedient race
they ride the candolescent flames,just smoke now,into a sky full of congratulations
in seas of grass take a good look,at the deluge of that rorschach we're standing out there,somewhere together
a narrow girl sells purses made of reed,dead rabbits hang by feet their red eyes dull,while chickens crammed in cages peck their seed
a vessel in juan's brain begins to bleed,spreading into the fissures of his skull,a narrow girl sells purses made of reed
the madams in the district underfeed,hookers they line up for a spectacle,while chickens crammed in cages peck their seed
a vendor buys his wares then smokes some weed,he seldom deems police an obstacle,a narrow girl sells purses made of reed
redeemers tend the poor avoiding greed,and never gesture for a miracle,while chickens crammed in cages peck their seed
we tore out onto jermyn street along which i performed,a sort of shuffle one eye on the book and one on m'lady's,competition-standard backside as she led us to the ritz
she climbs up poises a knife,and when the angle is right,i find executives in my pants
plunges the farmington knife,honey gushes out and,i find executives in my pants
he is harmless camera'd,in a muffled parliament of cantaloupe-motions,for every doubt a speech
circulates sometimes fogged and twitching in his house,not wishing you could not tell,exactly but wanting out

iwe lived on a lake with muscovy ducks,interior decorators flush with furniture plans,the ducks thrust with the thrust of youth
who's been trying to return,to earth since creation,and nearly succeeds every day
together where legion,hears the ventilator,and enters the wire
we like to think,that the mind,controls the body
the body is under,performing in heavy,trading
they're sexy,because they're needy,which degrades them
they're content to be,which degrades them,and is sweet
they want to be you,but can't,which is so hot
undercurrent of an unwillingness to believe all,is well in early spring beside a molten river riven by sun,its loud hush and glug through leafless aspens split by a gravel bar's pulled switch
the soil must have tasted,you once,it is laden with your scent
the trees honor you,in gold,and blush when you pass
i know why the desert,burns with fever,it was wept too long without you
on hands and knees,the ocean begs up the beach,and falls at your feet
i break a sweat the dish is still cold,read my palm do what it says,it's time that we get up on all fours
and for years i believed,that what went unsaid between us became empty,and pure like starlight  amp that it persisted
i got it all wrong,i wound up believing in words the way a scientist,believes in carbon after death
in his tremor he curses,the landlord who grins,from inside the rent book
i see this wild arena,where we are harnessed,by alien electric shadows
no wild zebras roam the american plain,the mad dogs are running,the african zebra is gone into the dust
up from msippi,i grew,wailing a song with every strain
fell from gun-powder come,as the first americans came,from asia
two men using a wheelbarrow could haul out,more than can thirty lazy indians,working an entire day
they die when they want to,saying they are only journeying,to the next village

eyes are glazed red from happiness,outside,the clouds swelled full of snow and ice
two leggings a ' a warrior's party,the tranquil dark,raven feathers a deep cold night fueled by a bonfire and beer
sometimes colorado,sometimes texas,always away
you can never tell about time either,like that it is,it is
unending,i wondered where they were all going,where
ocean to mountain to mesa the bundle she carries,is a sacred memory a rainbow that arches,from one side of the sky to the other
who should be the sterile chimera of earth and of another place,alien with a native face,native with an alien face
we brought hannah home today,in afternoon sun with a crisp chill in the air,on a hill overlooking the bay
tonight i have a date to share a steamy bath,with linda hogan and joy harjo,and it's gonna be gooooood
often i'd rise from my lullaby sleep and stare into the darkness of the road,the long darkness empty of cars,glowy from daddy's headlights and lonesome from hank williams' deep and twangy voice singing of cold nights and cheatin' hearts
if he could he would hang on her eye socket,peering inside,marveling at her displays
a raven's rib ripped from the electric socket,heats the palm,its rusted core bound by the apple's shaven hide
new york city france germany,we catch the scent of burning wood,we are brought home
you are a stubborn braid of wiingashk,that must be relit with a dozen matches,before it releases thin streamers of sweetness
you are the love song,played on a reedless flute,that only spirits hear
i am angry with my eyes for not seeing you,they smart and ache and see the snow,an insistent brilliance
red ambulance flicker curbstone wheels a gurney,down the breezeway a baby crying out among the gawk-mouthed heads,knifed sliced the man bleeding through the gauze and onto his belly
it reminds me of the night when my mother and i slept in our ltd while the cops surrounded our apartment complex,i remember someone standing near the yellow tape saying a had robbed the market across the street that the manager was shot twice,once in the arm once in the shoulder and that the gunmen were held up in their apartment squealing threats from their window
now when i look at her that same girl with a busted eye and lip i wonder: if when,she stabbed was she stabbing the boyfriend who beat her for burning supper or was,it her dad for wrenching his arm around her neck prodding a pistol at her head on that balmy night of echo and threat
and it would purr though of course,it being a house you would sit in its lap,not it in yours
and having reached the summit,would like to stay there,even if the stairs are withdrawn
her head and her hands do a jive in the air you can feel it,as the bus rolls on stopping at each red light in a long wheeze,jerking and idling rumbling up and lurching off again
and your libido,like a father but not like mine or my sons,fix it
doc said: it's a syndrome,you've got it,classic
wallet on bench,wallet at home,wallet at rest
i am at rudder at bow at mast at rigging,at deck at halyard at stern when the hold,explodes with screaming
one boy has stolen the other's marble,the boat shifts tilts,a wallet washes up against us
if you read our work let it not be an extension of our airs,but to correct our errs,in the book of agony
don't ask anyone: who am i,you know who your mother is,as for your father be your own
if you fall in love with a woman,be the one not she,who desires his end
you are like me but my abyss is clear,and you have roads whose secrets never end,they descend and ascend descend and ascend
example is not easy to attain,so be yourself and other than yourself,behind the borders of echo
ardor has an expiration date with extended range,so fill up with fervor for your heart's sake,follow it before you reach your path
don't place two stars in one utterance,and place the marginal next to the essential,to complete the rising rapture
you won't disappoint me,if you distance yourself from others and from me,what doesn't resemble me is more beautiful
wingless they build and repair,the mansions of what we have thought to be our inheritance,caution and candor they labor to maintain
to where they are mending their mansions beside of whose doors,they are standing at ease they are lifting the fans,of unburdenable wings
won't open to me it's shackled,inside its cage: love and rage,whose bars are meant to be broken
no one here remembers,the love of a chair for its ottoman,or the privacy of a shut door
windows grieve in their sashes,they burn with interior light,like blood oranges
as two who could not pretend,to love each other,we stared through grief
what i don't know,but learn to dread,turns over slowly in my bed
i don't want to be a clown but i'm,sure to be one,my mother was a clown
when i get back,i'm shooting everybody,[line omitted in memory of_____

triangle on every surface she saw be it phallic or,concave and sometimes this triangle was isosceles,sometimes it was equilateral and often it was right
say them,raise your hands,holler at me
interjections like flams,wham,bam
every morning,i look for you,on the menu
where are,your eyes and lips,my side order of thighs
what stays with you latest and deepest,of curious panics,of hard-fought engagements or sieges tremendous what deepest remains
he looks away watches the last of his ice,as it melts the way some godlike eye might see,the mighty glaciers in a slow dissolve back into sea
he notes how incommensurate the simile a last,attempt to dignify his shaking gaze and reaches,for the bill he's damned if the goat will pay
on rounds the newborns eyed me each one,like orpheus in his dark hallway saying,i knew i would find you i knew i would lose you
first there was jim clamping to my long black hair,that nine-pound cleopatra wig,with nylon bands and bobbie pins
meanwhile i was on fire for chad who coached me,a bit impatiently tuesday nights,on my joan-of-arc inflection
then terence said i'd be perfect for the lounge-singer,turned-whore and as it turned out,that was a fairly easy gig
max signed me on soon after claiming i was a natural,for eternally aggrieved girl,which in hindsight hurts me deeply
there is so much sweetness in children's voices,and so much discontent at the end of day,and so much satisfaction when a train goes by
i don't know why the rooster keeps crying,nor why elephants keep raising their trunks,nor why hawthorne kept hearing trains at night
a handsome child is a gift from god,and a friend is a vein in the back of the hand,and a wound is an inheritance from the wind
some say we are living at the end of time,but i believe a thousand pagan ministers,will arrive tomorrow to baptize the wind
it's all right if we don't know what the rooster,is saying in the middle of the night nor why we feel,so much satisfaction when a train goes by
in glock magazine sleeves,isn't it also then how why,in a bucket shot full of holes i've been made to believe
a single lilting line a single turn,of phrase: these always proved at last we learn,life cries for joy though it must end in tears
ravens at night hide in an old woman's shoe,a four-year-old speaks some ancient language,we have lived our own death a thousand times
mothers again and again have knelt in church,in wartime asking god to protect their sons,and their prayers were refused a thousand times
how many miles to the border,where all the sky there is,exists for the soul alone
there is a drumming in the shadows,under leaves: a million eight-eyed,spiders on the march
the buckeyes beat themselves,half to death against,some lit-from-within screen
i was just getting to that,but first old age,if you could just let me finish
amp as we rifled the fellow's bags before we fled,amp fled his time flew too,from his cuffs amp collars flapping ahead
i don't move,but the pigeon shudders,on the sill
can you imagine waking up,every morning on a different planet,each with its own gravity
a long time we were separate,o earth,but now you have returned to me
pointing at you at us at the rabble they sigh and say these abracadabra boys they lack jargons,they fail to distinguish between pustules and pistils,they knoweth not how the kumquat cometh

he balanced fives against tens,and made them sleep together,and love each other
he took sixes and sevens,and set them wrangling and fighting,over raw bones
he woke up twos and fours,out of baby sleep,and touched them back to sleep
he managed eights and nines,gave them prophet beards,marched them into mists and mountains
he added all the numbers he knew,multiplied them by new-found numbers,and called it a prayer of numbers
for each of a million cipher silences,he dug up a mate number,for a candle light in the dark
he knew love numbers luck numbers,how the sea and the stars,are made and held by numbers
he,couldn't even,something about his brother dying
there is an eagle in me and a mockingbird,and the eagle flies among the rocky mountains of my dreams and fights among the sierra crags of what i want,and the mockingbird warbles in the early forenoon before the dew is gone warbles in the underbrush of my chattanoogas of hope gushes over the blue ozark foothills of my wishes and i got the eagle and the mockingbird from the wilderness

somebody in dickens,attaching,diminutive eggs

she'll remark casually,sweet water,good to wash my hair
i know not my endurance and i know not my own power,i have died with heart exploded 'neath the cheering in the stands,calmly stood beneath the hanging noose of vigilante bands

he is thankful for strong knees,for momentum that lives,in the mouth and the hands
they climb the staircase clenching branches of pens filled with ducks' blood,and follow the butcher's bed into this room,goose feathers thorning out of their eyes
they promise to never look down again,down is just a speck of globe dust,just coins clanking in the tin box

within the poem he and she hot cold and luke,converge into flesh of vowels and consonant bones,or into uncanny affection of earth for water
we are like lanzmann,who cried when he learned,of the death of stalin
as for ideas,and theories,that's not my bag
are you worried about,death right now,at your age
while birds swept over the water,like pot-bellied angels,beautiful bells rang to assist the hoist
she stands at the top of the stair,as childless tom,saw her weep
now late in the years the wind lays,burnished gold leaves,on her feet

heavily plunged from the roof the snow,she answered my mother 'tis well i go,sparkled the north star the wrack flew high
first at his head and last at his feet,kneeling i watched till his soul did fleet,none else that loved him none else were nigh
i sought her afar through the spectral trees,the fells were all muffled the floods did freeze,and a wrathful moon hung red in the sky
by night i found her where pent waves steal,but she lay stiff by the locked mill-wheel,and the old stars lived in their homes on high
surely you know that poultry if cooked right,will cure most common psychic ills,it's something to do with the feathers

a clementine,of inclement climate,grows tart
a crocus,too stoic to open,won't
solitude is helpless to dispel,questions as exceptionably vexed,as unaccountable love's unaudited accounts
better perhaps to be sorry than safe after all,seeing no security could enable,one to scale unscathed the inexorable stair

sickness health abundance lack,the salt in my wound,the shirt off your back
maybe swallowtail maybe moth: trust me i know,because once i was a baby blue convertible,but now i'm this black hot rod painted with flames
what he said was,if we saw the cops outside smoking cigars,that's when we'd know we had a stinker

god climbs inside,asking for souls,something we weren't taught to share
this is the time,of the tragic man,that lies in the house of bedlam
erecting beyond the boundaries of all government his grand station and customs i find what i have made there a gate a staking out of his art in inconsequence,i have in mind a poetry that will frame the willingness of the heart and deliver it over to the arrest of time a sentence as if there could stand some solidity most spacial in its intent against the drifts and appearances that arise and fall away in time from the crude events of physical space,the mind alone holds the consequence of the erection to be true so that desire and imagination usurp the place of the invisible throne
not reading english,and hearing about a new english thriller,that hasn't been translated

the poems are gone,the light is dim,the dogs are on the basement stairs and coming up

i am a new man,i snarl at her and bark,i romp with joy in the bookish dark
suicide,a quitter,oh no
in the daytime i walk around with the ten,commandments on my lips,like an old tune someone hums to himself
i remember my father waking me for early prayers,he would do it by gently stroking my forehead not,by tearing away the blanket
you hear them while you wait and when the bus pulls up,finally and you get on,that was many years ago
she dances only in her necklace,scotch-lit surely,he touches his glasses
a good way to fall in love,is to turn off the headlights,and drive very fast down dark roads

you do less of,the sun,is too bright
yet all do still aver,the little babe lies buried there,beneath that hill of moss so fair
is love what we are,or has happiness come to me in a private car,that's so very small i'm amazed to see it there
the magic of numbers,how strange it was to hear the furniture being moved around in the apartment upstairs,i was twenty-six and you were twenty-two

their voicing ceased then started again to complain,that we are offered nothing when it starts to rain,in the same way though we are dying for the truth
i couldn't tell anyone about this sight,each defeat,is sweet
they'll dart underground when you try to catch them,plunge into quicksand whirlpools mazes,turn into scorpions when you try to catch them
we all just,trying to leave,a mark
i will be waiting,to be with you,then
in my waking hour i see,the remnant of the war between,my head and heart
your footsteps in and out of the bedroom,your lips touching my cheek lightly,and the sound of the door shutting
in your light,i fall asleep again under the warm quilt,happily like a child
the mountains hid santa anas,the smog went orange with dusk the growing shadows,of lingering birds
a living museum,exist to be observed,never migrate but live then die under the dome
lips lashes eyes,from outside in,do beings magnify under the dome
then with no warning,flukes of three orcas,rise arc clear of sea water
you are the man who walked out,as he walked in the bomb went off,and you lived to tell
look out,fore,i hate you
they are called the dead who lived through their deaths,and among my people,they are considered wise and honest
they float out of their bodies,and light on the ceiling like a moth,watching the efforts of everyone around them
i used toxins and poisons,to make you immaculate,i wanted you perfect
i nailed a no-trespassing sign,and a big security light to your side,i sold pieces of you off
season after season you return,sap rising up from your roots,unfinished always becoming
i defended against love,for as long as i could,until i couldn't
roll on roll on roll on,tonight i'm wearing a red dress,under a man's honeyed mouths and tent
through sacred ceremony of living daily living,arose three distinct hopes three loves,out of the long felt nights and days of yesterday
no,so is it what she is said to have said that night,when she breathed a secret and put the whole room on stall
the private eye the girl with a shadowy past the old-style cop,and it's nigh-on certain she'll have to take a bullet,or we'll see her in prison blue as they lead her to the drop
his smell still on her reek of the barley mow,and hers on him which could have been sloe,or sweat and sandalwood but you'd be the one to know
how kind time is altering space,so nothing stays wrong and light,more new light always arrives
nothing remained: nothing the wanton name,that nightly i rehearsed till led away,to a dark sleep or sleep that held one dream
in this a huge contagious absence lay,more space than space over the cloud and slime,defined but by the encroachments of its sway
stripped to indifference at the turns of time,whose end i knew i woke without desire,and welcomed zero as a paradigm
and there there i am,alone in that night,hearing that door slam
and the word she mouths to herself as she looks up from her book for,that word as she repeats it,repeats it
nightmare of beasthood snorting how to wake,i woke,what beasthood skin she made me take
into what bulk has method disappeared,like ham streaked,i am gross grey gross flap-eared
oh a man's flesh already is in mine,hand and foot poised for risk,buried in swine
notes we pinned to the trees told him,we moved to another,island that forms the sound
we live in the sound,he found,our voices pinned to the trees
then the return to words,thought has taken a contract out on,in order to move them around
blind man anvil,no hammer strikes,your eyes are spikes
that's not humility you see on our long final journeys,it's procrastination,it hurts my heavy body to lie down
so let me cease my scribbling for to-day,and maiden turn thy lovely face this way,words will not do but haply kisses may
the cliff above where we stand is crumbling,and up on the palisades,the sidewalks buckle like a broken conveyer belt
we walk back to the car,and take the top down for the ride home,through the early mist
where you live beyond the facts,of what your body has given you,as the first taste of death
consequences emerge when a man and desire,are part of the words we hurl you,changing how you mean loving this terrible final news
it was the hornbill that spoke it,in the nothing becoming nothing,begetting nothing this is everything
the evening empty as a convex,coconut split down the seam,not that it can be filled
the evening empty as a gourd,that twists on an iron thread,the rough skin of the sphere
the stars are suddenly remote,candescent petals night throws,above the yard the beautiful things
red,red,red
paula's paintings are real,the women thick visceral,like stubborn cliffs the sea cannot contain or drown
necromancer necromancer necromancer,make me a mate,only one of my ribs pray take
is that why in the photograph david plays,an inflatable lyre,does his smile make it all artifice
don't try to understand what another,person means by love,don't even bother
the critics will babble and frenzy,forever to find the nouns she never wrote,between the crowded verbs and adverbs
he called her: the heart and the womb,are similar,she called him: arrow in my heart
rose petals he picks up in the neighbor's yard,end up at tuesday's feet and,sprinkled through the sheets
you need that craft the precision of measurement,angles of angels,who incidentally are never women
i have to thank god i'm a woman,for in these ordered days a woman only,is free to be very hungry very lonely
and makes a curse,and makes a sugar of,the malocclusions the inconditions of love
when i put my finger to the hole they've cut for a dimmer switch,in a wall of plaster stiffened with horsehair,it seems i've scratched a two-hundred-year-old itch
of a chain of forms infinite,summed to a singular value,the elegy as a place to begin
it is a human love i live inside,a bony skeleton,you recognize as words or simple feeling
but it has no feeling,as the metal is hot it is not,given to love
the tour bus stops on the road's edge,on the right a black town the left indian,pointing he says: this is the racial divide
yet love hums like turning forks,and the fading spreading sound,is the growth of something more
the woman singing in zulu in a jamaican bar,is calling down fire calling down fire,there is no contradiction
when orators advertise the american eagle's,virtues the american eagle is not listening,this is his virtue
he is somewhere else he is mountains away,but even if he were near he would never,make an audience
if we have honored him we have honored one,who unequivocally honors himself by,overlooking us
he does not know the meaning of magnificent,perhaps we do not altogether either,who cannot touch him
and we are like the blind musician,at the hotel who tells us with a smile,i'll see you later
the leaf you pick from the fall,rises and dips away with every ridge,fingers stiff from time you trace
in front,the lead-coated horses don't seem to mind the officers,droppings
is that a gigantic molar,with worms popping out,such a variety of colors
they do things like suppress that,sidney poitier,is the best american actor ever
ooh he just dropped his wait,a babushka her her boot's,crkkkk
make sure you never think of any other social arrangement,other than one that,militarily has to dominate three quarter of the world
for a world,mocked-up terms,to contest
and into,timed pattern,a male's mine
work-a-day,transactions,transmission
preemptive,authorships,as progress
forming trends,at the base,asserting

there are two kinds of people soldiers and women,as virginia woolf said,both for decoration only
you are my stranger and see how we have closed,on both ends,night wets me all night blind carried
but you really love this woman how come no one can see this,everyone must,become suddenly very clumsy at recognizing beauty if you are to keep her
you don't want to lose anything at all ever,you want her sex depilated you,want everyone else not blind but perhaps paralyzed from the eyes down
the other replied,torn loose from the eaves,the blood trembles at the lips
till the villain left the paths of ease,to walk in perilous paths and drive,the just man into barren climes
romance already open on her lap,the bus laboring off into snow her good-bye kiss,still startling my cheek with lipstick trace
in the second taxi he was alone tra-la,but the clock showed sixpence extra he tipped according,you have left nothing behind tra-la between you
as for the fourth taxi he was alone,tra-la when he hailed it but the cabby looked,so many people not to speak of the dog
my roots are deep in southern life deeper than john brown or nat turner or robert lee,i was sired and weaned in a tropic world,the palm tree and banana leaf mango and coconut breadfruit and rubber trees know me
i want the cotton fields tabacco and the cane,i want to walk along with sacks of seed to drop in fallow ground,restless music is in my heart and i am eager to be gone
he cries that the magnets get stronger,when he peels the pods to find no difference,in the seeds of hunger and the seeds of love
in the alembic forged her shafts and hurled,at pain diseases waging a humane war,greater than this achievement none i ween

he told her about things she could see,how the dismal cover of clouds roils and explodes,and the ground aches like an old woman's knee
how wood rots against the tide,good for hunting grub,how to fade and fall back into the wind
that last night they drank from the river,sucked its delicate cusps of mold,sang anti social songs as if they were humans
when he flicked his handsome head,to catch the drift of wind,she even managed a single tear
the metallic conductor captured her eyes,she remembered how he proudly sang her name,as he pranced from pole-top to kv line
hence the delightsome gardens the dark shores,the terrifying forests where nightfall,enfolds a lost and tired traveler
and what shall we make of it love perhaps,what elevator is this anyway that even the prospect,of going down has made you high
is the color of emergency as i do,need saving from solid things,most of all their dissolve
that was the old landscape,all the new poems,map the two dimensions of cartoon ducks
see you tonight by the sovereign chartreuse,ceramics at the met,let's hear what you'd do differently
for an hour i stood on two legs,and ran,for an hour i panted and galloped
tomorrow mainly sunny,high sunshine and just a few clouds will fill the sky,breezes will turn and blow from the south ahead of a cold front approaching from canada
she may appear to be acting in a silent film whose placards are,missing,in hollywood the sky is made of tin
a witch makes her world of air then fire then the planets,of,cardboard then ink then a compass
she will know things she has not seen with her eyes,she will have,opinions about distant cities
the witch elm is sometimes referred to as all heart,as in she was,thrown into a common chest of witch elm
the boy alexander dreams of napoleon in john c,abbott's history napoleon the grand and lonely man wronged napoleon in his life wronged and in his memory wronged,the boy alexander dreams of the cat alice saw the cat fading off into the dark and leaving the teeth of its cheshire smile lighting the gloom
buffaloes blizzards way down in texas in the panhandle of texas snuggling close to new mexico,these creep into alexander's dreaming by the window when his father talks with strange men about land down in deaf smith county,alexander's father tells the strange men: five years ago we ran a ford out on the prairie and chased antelopes
o loose bloom,with no root,no seed
if an orchidophage's tastebud magnified,resembles an orchid,so my buds indubitably mimic pricking ice cream cones
between my finger and my thumb,the squat pen rests,i'll dig with it
as lightly as he touched the page before,where incarnation bloomed from roots that bore,the flowers i called christ's when i was four
through the meridian's fine blue hairlines the admirals are converging,in their fish-hulled ships with their frogmen and sirens and tanks with knotted chain flails,that beat the ground before them as they crawl
behind them the cities dim out on the foredeck the admirals sigh,to lean from the curving bows to trail,their fingertips in the water
like compass pencils of light their fingertips spread out,the nervous systems more complex than spiral nebulae,orchards of mines grow up on the ocean floor
only the grassblown norman ringmounds go on dreaming,of monet picture hats and streaming scarves,the bunker disguised as a picnic that went on forever
now the cathedral at bayeux with its window and views is rolled up,and the conqueror's navy on its blue worsted waves,and hengist and horsa the escorial with its green shoals of ships all are safely rolled up
carhoods streaming the fractalized shadows of chain links,and sledges laden with wattles with yellowy rolls of oiled paper,to seal up the windows of snowy muscovy or minsk
i knew always that i would be a worker in the vineyard,as are all men and women living at the same time,whether they are aware of it or not
but you must have hope and you must have faith,if you work if you wait you will find the place,where the four-leaf clovers grow
or out with those crazy girls those teenagers laughing,on a christmas shopping spree free (the only day they,let us out in two months) feet wet and cold from snow
but that dashing dauntless delphic diehard diabolic cracker likes his fiction turned with a certain elegance and wit and that anti-anti-anti-slum-congestion clublady prefers romance,search through the mothballs comb the lavender and lace,were her desires and struggles futile or did an innate fineness bring him at last to a prouder richer peace in a world gone somehow mad
occasionally lifting their eyes to watch the groundsmen at their antics,not just hope over experience but hope over certain knowledge,it was like staying to watch your horse lose
and yet there was some residual sense of good fortune to be there,perhaps it was the fresh air or being safely out of range of conversation,or the infinitesimal prospect of infinitesimal entertainment
he wondered about the word so filled with breath,yet breathless breathless breathless,a full stop
son we were oak without,mouth uncut we were,brave before memory
we will blaze forth,what remains,as pixels
and so it somehow had to be,you did it for them,you erupted out of englishness and made an exhibition of yourself
you are a joy forever though a thing of beauty nit,and from her madder eyebrows to her utmost purple swirl,against all captious critics i'll defend the poster girl
to start over,in the carved moment,is to take cover
alone,up a sidewalk,laid down for her
please ease,of song,my tongue
so the old miracle anew,and crumbs apportioned for a few,god-blessed suffice a multitude
i dry dishes in the afternoon,watch her can apples from,the backyard put them in the cellar dark to save for winter

mn,i saw his eyes,i saw some old olive groves
a,he he who lets nothing,is cut by his shadow and walks away
mn,his words are white and unspeakable,his eyes deep and without sleep

i have been one acquainted with the night,i have walked out in rain and back in rain,i have outwalked the furthest city light
i have looked down the saddest city lane,i have passed by the watchman on his beat,and dropped my eyes unwilling to explain
a page torn from a book,still blank for the two of us,a mother and her child
savage and burning the barrow he circled,all without nor was any there,none in the waste

with an impudent wag of the head,and he once went a walk paw-in-paw with a bear,just to keep up its spirits he said

the jury had each formed a different view,and they all spoke at once so that none of them knew,one word that the others had said

of course there is nothing the matter with the stars,it is my emptiness among them,while they drift farther away in the invisible morning
the circles of the stormy moon,slide westward toward the river plate,death and the raven drift above
stronger than memory,and weaker than dewdrops and i would have said,my identity is this expanse
i attack and retreat like the violin in quatrains,i get far from my time when i am near,the topography of place
there is no margin in modern language left,to celebrate what we love,because all that will be
not because of anything,other than that the play was not written,skillfully
water,binds me,to your name
and we are now loosened,from the gravity of identity's land,what will we do
what,will we do without exile and a long night,that stares at the water
before i am lost,hell must open like a red rose,for the dead to pass
cease gentle muse,the solemn gloom of night,now seals the fair creation from my sight
i kissed a woman,whose freckles,aroused our neighbors
she takes my toe,in her mouth,bites lightly

they are bombing his hospital office,but i am a ripe woman,a man could be happy
i always thought reality,was something you became,when you grew up
in the square stands fata morgana,looking tired shouting,morning paper morning paper
with his ass and cart messiah crawls,and cries out: any old iron,any old shoes
the mouth of the living is awash with spit it has enough to melt and wash within it,pigs and fish and cakes and still have enough to spit at friends,and the dead man's dry mouth has not enough to silently swallow the disgrace of his death
and the dead man lay on his couch and the mold of a skeleton,was already drawn through the torn ends of his flesh,and his face is turned on high expectantly and waits for his daddy
for he too the daddy is an orphan he too has no daddy,and he too wants why not to hide his face in his father's neck,and find there the consolations of his life and death
and the dead man cried a desperate cry for his base life that was lost,and no one heard the dead man's awful moan,for it was choked in the hollow of his mouth that was stuffed with earth

my friend is smaller now and if i held my camera up,to her she would give off enough light to hover,pocket-sized in my hand and grand in the world

your name to the squat gray,dog on wheels tipping on its side,as she drags it by a red string
already i am becoming the valley,a soil that sprouts nothing,for any of us
the sky went black in the ninth hour of rolling trays,and in the distance ropes of rain dropped to pull me,from the thick harvest that was not mine
fog,if you go to your window,you will notice a fog drifting in
woe to you watch out,you sons of bitches who would drive men and women,to the fields where they can only die
even with insects,some can sing,some can't

i never sought him in coquettish sport,or courted him as silly maidens court,and wonder when the longed-for prize falls short
i only loved him any woman would,but shut my love up till he came and sued,then poured it o'er his dry life like a flood

so i built my house upon another's ground,mocked with a heart just caught at the rebound,a cankered thing that looked so firm and sound
i say again he gives me all i claimed,i and my children never shall be shamed,he is a just man he will live unblamed

squares more bright and with lovelier light than heaven that kindled it shines with shine,warm and soft as the dome aloft but heavenlier yet than the sun's own shrine,heaven is high but the water-sky lit here seems deeper and more divine
rosy grey or as fiery spray full-plumed or greener than emerald gleams,plot by plot as the skies allot for each its glory divine as dreams,lit with fire of appeased desire which sounds the secret of all that seems
aught more fair than the radiant air and water here by the twilight wed,here made one by the waning sun whose last love quickens to rosebright red,half the crown of the soft high down that rears to northward its wood-girt head
higher and higher to the north aspire the green smooth-swelling unending downs,east and west on the brave earth's breast glow girdle-jewels of gleaming towns,southward shining the lands declining subside in peace that the sea's light crowns
westward wide in its fruitful pride the plain lies lordly with plenteous grace,fair as dawn's when the fields and lawns desire her glitters the glad land's face,eastward yet is the sole sign set of elder days and a lordlier race
yet shall these when the winds and seas of equal days and coequal nights,rage rejoice and uplift a voice whose sound is even as a sword that smites,felt and heard as a doomsman's word from seaward reaches to landward heights
lift their heart up and take their part of triumph swollen and strong with rage,rage elate with desire and great with pride that tempest and storm assuage,so their chime in the ear of time has rung from age to rekindled age
fame wherever her flag flew never forbore to fly with an equal wing,france and spain with their warrior train bowed down before her as thrall to king,india knelt at her feet and felt her sway more fruitful of life than spring
darkness round them as iron bound fell off from races of elder name,slain at sight of her eyes whose light bids freedom lighten and burn as flame,night endures not the touch that cures of kingship tyrants and slaves of shame
yet the might of her wings in flight whence glory lightens and music rings,loud and bright as the dawn's shall smite and still the discord of evil things,yet not slain by her radiant reign but darkened now by her sail-stretched wings
music made of change and conquest glory born of evil slain,stilled the discord slew the darkness bade the lights of tempest wane,where the deathless dawn of england rose in sign that right should reign
mercy where the tiger wallowed mad and blind with blood and lust,justice where the jackal yelped and fed and slaves allowed it just,rose as england's light on asia rose and smote them down to dust
justice bright as mercy mercy girt by justice with her sword,smote and saved and raised and ruined till the tyrant-ridden horde,saw the lightning fade from heaven and knew the sun for god and lord
where the footfall sounds of england where the smile of england shines,rings the tread and laughs the face of freedom fair as hope divines,days to be more brave than ours and lit by lordlier stars for signs
all our past acclaims our future: shakespeare's voice and nelson's hand,milton's faith and wordsworth's trust in this our chosen and chainless land,bear us witness: come the world against her england yet shall stand
earth and sea bear england witness if he lied who said it he,whom the winds that ward her waves that clasp and herb and flower and tree,fed with english dews and sunbeams hail as more than man may be
no man ever spake as he that bade our england be but true,keep but faith with england fast and firm and none should bid her rue,none may speak as he: but all may know the sign that shakespeare knew
and ever as time's flow brightened a river more dark than the storm-clothed sea,and age upon age rose fairer and larger in promise of hope set free,with england eton her child kept pace as a fostress of men to be
shelley lyric lord of england's lordliest singers here first heard,ring from lips of poets crowned and dead the promethean word,whence his soul took fire and power to outsoar the sunward-soaring bird
still the reaches of the river still the light on field and hill,still the memories held aloft as lamps for hope's young fire to fill,shine and while the light of england lives shall shine for england still
when four hundred more and fifty years have risen and shone and set,bright with names that men remember loud with names that men forget,haply here shall eton's record be what england finds it yet
two years more than the full fourscore lay hallowing hands on a sacred head,scarce one score of the perfect four uncrowned of fame as they smiled and fled,still and soft and alive aloft their sunlight stays though the suns be dead
soon ere time in the rounding rhyme of choral seasons had hailed us men,we too heard and acclaimed the word whose breath was life upon england then,life more bright than the breathless light of soundless noon in a songless glen
ah the joy of the heartstruck boy whose ear was opened of love to hear,ah the bliss of the burning kiss of song and spirit the mounting cheer,lit with fire of divine desire and love that knew not if love were fear
fear and love as of heaven above and earth enkindled of heaven were one,one white flame that around his name grew keen and strong as the worldwide sun,awe made bright with implied delight as weft with weft of the rainbow spun
we that knew when the sun's shaft flew beheld and worshipped adored and heard,light rang round it of shining sound whence all men's hearts were subdued and stirred,joy love sorrow the day the morrow took life upon them in one man's word
not for him can the years wax dim nor downward swerve on a darkening way,upward wind they and leave behind such light as lightens the front of may,fair as youth and sublime as truth we find the fame that we hail to-day
far above us and all our love beyond all reach of its voiceless praise,shines for ever the name that never shall feel the shade of the changeful days,fall and chill the delight that still sees winter's light on it shine like may's
england glows as a sunlit rose from mead to mountain from sea to sea,bright with love and with pride above all taint of sorrow that needs must be,needs must live for an hour and give its rainbow's glory to lawn and lea
not through tears shall the new-born years behold him crowned with applause of men,pass at last from a lustrous past to life that lightens beyond their ken,glad and dead and from earthward led to sunward guided of imogen
frail,but fame's breath quickens kindles keeps in ward,life so sweet as this that dies and casts off death
dont on entend parfois dans notre nuit profonde,s'il vous aima s'il vous pleura lui dont la vie,recevez
love should he wake bears now no cross for him,dead hope whose living eyes like his were dim,has brought forth better comfort strength more strong
o loud and loud was the live man's cry,would god the dead and the slain were i,and the wind wears owre the heather
o sair was the wrang and sair the fray,but liefer had love be slain than slay,and the wind wears owre the heather
o sweet is the life that sleeps at hame,but i maun wake on a far sea's faem,and the wind wears owre the heather
and women are fairest of a' things fair,but never shall i kiss woman mair,and the wind wears owre the heather
between the birk and the aik and the thorn,he's laid his brother to lie forlorn,and the wind wears owre the heather
between the bent and the burn and the broom,he's laid him to sleep till dawn of doom,and the wind wears owre the heather
he's tane him owre the waters wide,afar to fleet and afar to bide,and the wind wears owre the heather
his hair was yellow his cheek was red,when he set his face to the wind and fled,and the wind wears owre the heather
his banes were stark and his een were bright,when he set his face to the sea by night,and the wind wears owre the heather
his cheek was wan and his hair was grey,when he came back hame frae the wide world's way,and the wind wears owre the heather
his banes were weary his een were dim,and nae man lived and had mind of him,and the wind wears owre the heather
o whatten a wreck wad they seek on land,that they houk the turf to the seaward hand,and the wind wears owre the heather
o whatten a prey wad they think to take,that they delve the dykes for a dead man's sake,and the wind wears owre the heather
o whatten a slayer is this they said,that the straik of his hand should raise his dead,and the wind wears owre the heather
o weel is me for the sign i take,that now i may die for my auld sin's sake,and the wind wears owre the heather
for the dead was in wait now fifty year,and now shall i die for his blood's sake here,and the wind wears owre the heather
storm and shame and fraud and darkness fill the nations full with night,hope and fear whose eyes yearn eastward have but fire and sword in sight,one alone whose name is one with glory sees and seeks the light
hellas mother of the spirit sole supreme in war and peace,land of light whose word remembered bids all fear and sorrow cease,lives again while freedom lightens eastward yet for sons of greece
greece where only men whose manhood was as godhead ever trod,bears the blind world witness yet of light wherewith her feet are shod,freedom armed of greece was always very man and very god
now the winds of old that filled her sails with triumph when the fleet,bound for death from asia fled before them stricken wake to greet,ships full-winged again for freedom toward the sacred shores of crete
there was god born man the song that spake of old time said: and there,man made even as god by trust that shows him nought too dire to dare,now may light again the beacon lit when those we worship were
sharp the concert wrought of discord shrills the tune of shame and death,turk by christian fenced and fostered mecca backed by nazareth,all the powerless powers tongue-valiant breathe but greed's or terror's breath
though the tide that feels the west wind lift it wave by widening wave,wax not yet to height and fullness of the storm that smites to save,none shall bid the flood back seaward till no bar be left to brave
in the sun-coloured mists of the sunrise and sunset that steam,as incense from urns of the twilight her portals ajar,let pass as a shadow the light of the sound of a dream
the snake that felt thy heel upon her head,night's first-born writhes as though she were not dead,but strikes not stings not slays not as before
the shadow shed round those we love shines bright,as love's own face when death sleep's gentler twin,from them divides us even as night from light
his years were full: his years were joyous: why,must love be sorrow when his gracious name,recalls his lovely life of limb and eye
a child's light hands whose touch makes flowers more fair,keep fair as these for many a march and may,the light of days that are because they were
a babe's hands open as to greet,the tender touch of ours,and mock with motion faint and fleet
what man would risk the danger twice,nor quake from head to heel,whom would not one such test suffice
what heart of man dare hold the lists,against such odds and such,sweet vantage as no strength resists
lo the cloud of his ships that crowd her channel's inlet with storm sublime,darker far than the tempests are that sweep the skies of her northmost clime,huge and dense as the walls that fence the secret darkness of unknown time
squadrons proud as their lords and loud with tramp of soldiers and chant of priests,slaves there told by the thousandfold made fast in bondage as herded beasts,lords and slaves that the sweet free waves shall feed on satiate with funeral feasts
full july in the fervent sky sets forth her twentieth of changing morns,winds fall mild that of late waxed wild: no presage whispers or wails or warns,far to west on the bland sea's breast a sailing crescent uprears her horns
but the lord of darkness the god whose love is a flaming fire,the master whose mercy fulfils wide hell till its torturers tire,he shall surely have heed of his servants who serve him for love not hire
they shall fetter the wing of the wind whose pinions are plumed with foam,for now shall thy horn be exalted and now shall thy bolt strike home,yea now shall thy kingdom come lord god of the priests of rome
they shall cast thy curb on the waters and bridle the waves of the sea,they shall say to her peace be still: and stillness and peace shall be,and the winds and the storms shall hear them and tremble and worship thee
thy breath shall darken the morning and wither the mounting sun,and the daysprings frozen and fettered shall know thee and cease to run,the heart of the world shall feel thee and die and thy will be done
the spirit of man that would sound thee and search out causes of things,shall shrink and subside and praise thee: and wisdom with plume-plucked wings,shall cower at thy feet and confess thee that none may fathom thy springs
the fountains of song that await but the wind of an april to be,to burst the bonds of the winter and speak with the sound of a sea,the blast of thy mouth shall quench them: and song shall be only of thee
the days that are dead shall quicken the seasons that were shall return,and the streets and the pastures of england the woods that burgeon and yearn,shall be whitened with ashes of women and children and men that burn
yea so shall thy kingdom be stablished and so shall the signs of it be,and the world shall know and the wind shall speak and the sun shall see,that these are the works of thy servants whose works bear witness to thee
but the dusk of the day falls fruitless whose light should have lit them on,sails flash through the gloom to shoreward eclipsed as the sun that shone,and the west wind wakes with dawn and the hope that was here is gone
around they wheel and around two knots to the spaniard's one,the wind-swift warriors of england who shoot as with shafts of the sun,with fourfold shots for the spaniard's that spare not till day be done
and the wind with the sundown sharpens and hurtles the ships to the lee,and spaniard on spaniard smites and shatters and yields and we,ere battle begin stand lords of the battle acclaimed of the sea
and the day sweeps round to the nightward and heavy and hard the waves,roll in on the herd of the hurtling galleons and masters and slaves,reel blind in the grasp of the dark strong wind that shall dig their graves
for the sepulchres hollowed and shaped of the wind in the swerve of the seas,the graves that gape for their pasture and laugh thrilled through by the breeze,the sweet soft merciless waters await and are fain of these
as the hiss of a python heaving in menace of doom to be,they hear through the clear night round them whose hours are as clouds that flee,the whisper of tempest sleeping the heave and the hiss of the sea
but faith is theirs and with faith are they girded and helmed and shod,invincible are they almighty elect for a sword and a rod,invincible even as their god is omnipotent infinite god
in him is their strength who have sworn that his glory shall wax not dim,in his name are their war-ships hallowed as mightiest of all that swim,the men that shall cope with these and conquer shall cast out him
sixtus pope of the church whose hope takes flight for heaven to dethrone the sun,philip king that wouldst turn our spring to winter blasted appalled undone,prince and priest let a mourner's feast give thanks to god for your conquest won
england hates thee as hell's own gates and england triumphs and rome bows down,england mocks at thee england's rocks cast off thy servants to drive and drown,england loathes thee and fame betroths and plights with england her faith for crown
spain clings fast to thee spain aghast with anguish cries to thee where art thou,spain puts trust in thee lo the dust that soils and darkens her prostrate brow,spain is true to thy service who shall raise up spain for thy service now
lords of night who would breathe your blight on april's morning and august's noon,god your lord the condemned the abhorred sinks hellward smitten with deathlike swoon,death's own dart in his hateful heart now thrills and night shall receive him soon
god the devil thy reign of revel is here for ever eclipsed and fled,god the liar everlasting fire lays hold at last on thee hand and head,god the accurst the consuming thirst that burns thee never shall here be fed
england queen of the waves whose green inviolate girdle enrings thee round,mother fair as the morning where is now the place of thy foemen found,still the sea that salutes us free proclaims them stricken acclaims thee crowned
greed and fraud unabashed unawed may strive to sting thee at heel in vain,craft and fear and mistrust may leer and mourn and murmur and plead and plain,thou art thou: and thy sunbright brow is hers that blasted the strength of spain
o hearts that strain and burn,as fires fast fettered burn and strain,bow down lie still and learn
but heavens beyond us yearn,yea heights of heaven above the sway,of stars that eyes discern
night sinks on the soul and the stars as they gleam,speak menace or mourning with tongues to reprove us,that we deemed of them better than terror may deem
april made me: winter laid me here away asleep,bright as maytime was my daytime night is soft and deep,though the morrow bring forth sorrow well are ye that weep
ye that held me dear beheld me not a twelvemonth long,all the while ye saw me smile ye knew not whence the song,came that made me smile and laid me here and wrought you wrong
angels calling from your brawling world one undefiled,homeward bade me and forbade me here to rest beguiled,here i sleep not: pass and weep not here upon your child
the love made strong with knowledge whence confirmed,the whole soul takes assurance and the past,lives present life and mingles first with last
o mother where is my great green bed,silk at the foot and gold at the head,mother my mother
she laid her cheek to the velvet and vair,one with another,she laid her arms up under her hair
her gold hair fell through her arms fu' low,one with another,lord god bring me out of woe
her gold hair fell in the gay reeds green,one with another,lord god bring me out of teen
he kissed her down by her breast-flowers red,one with another,they were like river-flowers dead
as all men's hearts grew godlike in one bird,and all those hearts cried on thee crying with might,hear us o mother night
forgive me that with bitter words like his,i mix the gentlest english name that is,the tenderest held of all that know not death
peace upon earth thou knewest not: now being dead,rest with nor curse nor blessing on thine head,where high-strung hate and strenuous envy cease
first edition,reprinted,may
oh never a doubt but somewhere i shall wake,and give what's left of love again and make,new friends now strangers
where the first crocus buds unfold,we found these petals near the cold,swift river-bed
beneath the rocks where ivy-frond,puts forth new leaves to gleam beyond,those lately dead
never more will the wind,cherish you again,never more will the rain
never more,shall we find you bright,in the snow and wind
the snow is melted,the snow is gone,and you are flown
like a bird out of our hand,like a light out of our heart,you are gone
here in our wicker-trays,we bring the first faint blossoming,of fragrant bays
(ah love,so her fair breasts will shine,with the faint shadow above
from citron-bower be her bed,cut from branch of tree a-flower,fashioned for her maidenhead
from lydian apples sweet of hue,cut the width of board and lathe,carve the feet from myrtle-wood
let the palings of her bed,be quince and box-wood overlaid,with the scented bark of yew
that all the wood in blossoming,may calm her heart and cool her blood,for losing of her maidenhood
what of her,mistress of death,what of his kiss
beauty is set apart,from the islands,and from greece
in my garden,even the wind-flowers lie flat,broken by the wind at last
what is rhodes crete,what is paros facing west,what white imbros
flower sent to flower,for white hands the lesser white,less lovely of flower leaf
can the spice-rose,drip such acrid fragrance,hardened in a leaf
your lights are but dank shoals,slate and pebble and wet shells,and seaweed fastened to the rocks
with the turn and grasp of your wrist,and the chords' stretch,there is a glint like worn brass
life is a scavenger's pit i escape,i only rejecting it,lying here on this couch
the house too was like this,over painted over lovely,the world is like this
i have had enough,border-pinks clove-pinks wax-lilies,herbs sweet-cress
treasure,spilled near the shrub-pines,to bleach on the boulders
and the marsh dragged one back,and another perished under the cliff,and the tide swept you out
you stood almost level,with the lance-bearers,and so slight
you are clear,o rose cut in rock,hard as the descent of hail
i could scrape the colour,from the petals,like spilt dye from a rock
o wind rend open the heat,cut apart the heat,rend it to tatters
i wondered at you,i shouted dear mysterious beautiful,white myrtle-flesh
i was splintered and torn,the hill-path mounted,swifter than my feet
have you heard o god seated on the cliff,how far toward the ledges of your house,how far i had to walk
bear me to dictaeus,and to the steep slopes,to the river erymanthus
as i pass down the corridor,past desperate faces at each cell,your eyes and my eyes may meet
an old pond,and the sound of a frog leaping,into the water
on the mountain-road,there is no flower more beautiful,than the wild violet
there is faint sound of quavering strings,the reedy murmurs of a flute,the soft sigh of the wind through silken garments
and the prince came to the craggy rock,but saw only hissing waves,so he rested all day amid them
he dreams it is the murmur,of distant wave-caps breaking,upon the painted screen
the peony dancer,swirls orange folds of dusty robes,through the summer
heavy blooms,breaking and spilling fiery cups,drowsily
faint rose anticipation colours her,and sunset,she is a cherry-tree that has taken long to bloom
late summer changes to autumn,chrysanthemums are scattered,behind the palings
far in the shadow,the daimyo's attendant waits,nervously fingering his sword
wave on wave her heavy robes collapse,in green torrents,lashed with slaty foam
downward the sun strikes amid them,and enkindles a lone flower,a violet iris standing yet in seething pools of grey
swift waves hissing,under the moonlight,tarnished silver
swaying boats,under the moonlight,gold lacquered prows
she dreamed of some lover,to whom she might offer her body,fresh and cool as a flower born in the rain
in their bark of bamboo reeds,the heavenly poetesses,float across the sky
my thoughts are sparrows passing,through one great wave that breaks,in bubbles of gold on a black motionless rock
in his face were written ages,of patient treachery,and the knowledge of his hour
my love for her at first was like the smoke that drifts,across the marshes,from burning woods
but after she had gone,it was like the lotus that lifts up,its heart shaped buds from the dim waters
my heart is mournful as thunder moving,through distant hills,late on a long still night of autumn
on my heart is the black badge of exile,i droop over it,i accept its shame
through the weak spring rains,two lovers walk together,holding together the parasol
spring rain falls through the cherry blossom,in long blue shafts,on grasses strewn with delicate stars
the summer rain sifts through the drooping willow,shatters the courtyard,leaving grey pools
the autumn rain drives through the maples,scarlet threads of sorrow,towards the snowy earth
let my song sigh as the breeze through the cryptomerias,and pause like long flags flapping,and dart and flutter aloft like a wind-bewildered crane
although there was no sound in all the house,i could not forbear listening for the cry of those long white rippling waves,dragging up their strength to break on the sullen beach of the sky
the harmonies of the robes of this gay lady,are like chants within a temple sweeping outwards,to the morn
sparrows and tame magpies chatter,in the porticoes,lit with many a lantern
there is idle song,scandal over full wine cups,sorrow does not matter
the green and violet peacocks,with golden tails,parade
beneath the fluttering jangling streamers,they walk,violet and gold
her life was like a swiftly rushing stream,green and scarlet,falling into darkness
then in her heart they grew,the snows of changeless winter,stirred by the bitter winds of unsatisfied desire
my thoughts are an autumn breeze,lifting and hurrying,dry rubbish about in a corner
my thoughts are willow branches,already broken,motionless at twilight
the wind shakes the mists,making them quiver,with faint drum-tones of thunder
out of the crane-haunted mists of autumn,blue and brown,rolls the moon
despair hangs in the broken folds of my garments,it clogs my footsteps,like snow in the cherry bloom
pilgrims will ascend the road in early summer,passing my tombstone,mossy long forgotten
because of the long pallid petals of white chrysanthemums,waving to and fro,i dare not go
swallows twittering at twilight,waves of heat,churned to flames by the sun
a piece of paper ready to toss in the fire,blackened scrawled with fragments of an incomplete song,my soul
there is a goddess who walks shrouded by day,at night she throws her blue veil over the earth,men only see her naked glory through the little holes in the veil
the splaying silhouette of horse-chestnut leaves,against the tall and delicate patrician-tinged sky,like a princess in blue robes behind a grille of bronze
in that bower there is a chair,where doth sit the fairest fair,that did ever eye behold
this is she the wise the rich,that the world desires to see,there is none but only she
thus at base they run they run,when the sport was scarce begun,but i waked and all was done
no i say and think and write it,write and think and say your pleasure,love and truth and i indite it
and,and no man e'er,know why
and now oh,now,i die
mine eyes shall be th' interpreters alone,by them conceive my thoughts and tell me fair,if now you see her that doth love me there

then he pursues his journey,rides through the dale and looks about,he sees no sign of a resting-place but only high and steep banks
the other reproved him saying,thou art not gawayne that is so good esteemed,for thou fleest for fear before thou feelest harm
and addressed him as follows: bold knight be not so wroth,i promised thee a stroke and thou hast it be satisfied,i could have dealt worse with thee

he still carried about him the belt,a belef as a bauderyk bounden bi his syde,in token of his fault
thus he comes to the court of king arthur,great then was the joy of all,the king and his knights ask him concerning his journey

from the recesses of a lowly spirit,our humble prayer ascends o father,hear it
who hast within thine equal heed,the rolling sun the ripening seed,the azure of the speedwell's eye
it is not wisdom to be only wise,and on the inward vision close the eyes,but it is wisdom to believe the heart
our knowledge is a torch of smoky pine,that lights the pathway but one step ahead,across a void of mystery and dread

faithe of the fathers olde,which makes me verye bolde,to fear no worldes distress
all weakness i,on him rely,who fixed the earth and spread the starry sky
if he is nigh,howe'er i die,t will be the dawn of heavenly ecstasy
beholding thee,what bliss 't will be,with all thy saints to spend eternity
from sorrow sin and frailty free,beholding and resembling thee,o too transporting sight
haste,haste,my lord and soon transport me there
such a joy as none can move,such a love as none can part,such a heart as joys in love
unfading hope,when life's last embers burn,when soul to soul and dust to dust return

he cried aloud and listened and then knocked,and uttered awful threatenings and complaints,and imprecations upon men and saints
half choked with rage king robert fiercely said,open: 'tis i the king,art thou afraid
to which king robert answered with a sneer,i am the king and come to claim my own,from an impostor who usurps my throne
but the straw rustled as he turned his head,there were the cap and bells beside his bed,around him rose the bare discolored walls
close by the steeds were champing in their stalls,and in the corner a revolting shape,shivering and chattering sat the wretched ape

gazed at the angel's countenance serene,the emperor laughing said it is strange sport,to keep a madman for thy fool at court
and through the chant a second melody,rose like the throbbing of a single string,i am an angel and thou art the king
king robert who was standing near the throne,lifted his eyes and lo,he was alone
arise he said my angels,a wail of woe and sin,steals through the gates of heaven and saddens all within
and lo,that tear of pity quenched the flame whereon it fell,and with the sunshine of that smile hope entered into hell
welcome my angels,ye have brought a holier joy to heaven,henceforth its sweetest song shall be the song of sin forgiven
if i enter heaven i may not pass,to where they be,though the wail of their bitter pain alas
and the white-robed saints with their crowns and palms,are good to see,and oh so grand are the sounding psalms
and bear its shame,and clasp to his heart for love of me,my guilt and blame

my spirit beats her mortal bars,as down dark tides the glory slides,and star-like mingles with the stars

and is mine one,said abou,nay not so
with dovelike wings peace o'er yon village broods,the dizzying mill-wheel rests the anvil's din,hath ceased all all around is quietness
and when refreshed the soul once more puts on new life and power,oh let thine image,lord alone gild the first waking hour

when brightly shines the prosperous day,be thoughts of thee a cloudy screen,to temper the deceitful ray

not that amassing flowers,youth sighed which rose make ours,which lily leave and then as best recall
not that admiring stars,it yearned nor jove nor mars,mine be some figured flame which blends transcends them all
not for such hopes and fears,annulling youth's brief years,do i remonstrate folly wide the mark
rather i prize the doubt,low kinds exist without,finished and finite clods untroubled by a spark
rejoice we are allied,to that which doth provide,and not partake effect and not receive
a spark disturbs our clod,nearer we hold of god,who gives than of his tribes that take i must believe
then welcome each rebuff,that turns earth's smoothness rough,each sting that bids nor sit nor stand but go
what is he but a brute,whose flesh hath soul to suit,whose spirit works lest arms and legs want play
to man propose this test,thy body at its best,how far can that project thy soul on its lone way
as the bird wings and sings,let us cry all good things,are ours nor soul helps flesh more now than flesh helps soul
be there for once and all,severed great minds from small,announced to each his station in the past
what though the earlier grooves,which ran the laughing loves,around thy base no longer pause and press
what though about thy rim,scull-things in order grim,grow out in graver mood obey the sterner stress

this is life to come,which martyred men have made more glorious,for us who strive to follow
an infant crying in the night,an infant crying for the light,and with no language but a cry

god therefore cannot hurt ye and be just,not just not god: not feared then nor obeyed,your fear itself of death removes the fear

toil on sad heart courageously,and thou shalt find thy dream to be,a noonday light and truth to thee

if i bleed,his feet have bled: yea in my need,his heart once bled for mine indeed
so he was young,who for my sake in silence hung,upon the cross with passion wrung

and willingly to suffer mercy's rod,joy in his grace and live but in his love,and seek my bliss but in the world above
and i would frame a kind of faithful prayer,for all estates within the state of grace,that careful love might never know despair
nor servile fear might faithful love deface,and this would i both day and night devise,to make my humble spirit's exercise

the sun's eye had a sickly glare,the skeletons of nations were,around that lonely man
some had expired in fight the brands,still rusted in their bony hands,in plague and famine some
earth's cities had no sound nor tread,and ships were drifting with the dead,to shores where all was dumb
my lips that speak thy dirge of death,their rounded gasp and gurgling breath,to see thou shalt not boast

so spake the wise old warrior,and all about him cried,paulinus' god hath conquered
who leads us with a gentle hand,thither oh thither,into the silent land
who in life's battle firm doth stand,shall bear hope's tender blossoms,into the silent land
let death between us be as naught,a dried and vanished stream,your joy be the reality
but lying darkly between,winding down through the night,is the silent unknown stream
that heart whose fondest throbs to me were given,my name on earth was ever in thy prayer,and wilt thou never utter it in heaven
the love that lived through all the stormy past,and meekly with my harsher nature bore,and deeper grew and tenderer to the last

the lover there drank her delicious breath,whose love has yielded since to change or death,the mother kissed her child whose days are o'er
they whom we loved and lost so long ago,dwell in those cities far from mortal woe,haunt those fresh woodlands whence sweet carollings soar
who would not go,with buoyant steps to gain that blessed portal,which opens to the land we long to know
where shall be satisfied the soul's immortal,where we shall drop the wearying and the woe,in resting so
fairer than all our spirit's fairest dreaming,eye hath not seen no heart can understand,the things prepared the cloudless radiance streaming

how oft do they with golden pinions cleave,the flitting skyes like flying pursuivant,against fowle feendes to ayd us militant
mine eyes their vigils keep,for very love beholding,thy happy name they weep
o paradise of joy,where tears are ever banished,and smiles have no alloy
o lovelier far than gold,with laurel-girt battalions,and safe victorious fold
the lord shall be thy part,his only his forever,thou shalt be and thou art
there lust and lucre cannot dwell,there envy bears no sway,there is no hunger thirst nor heat
oh,that my sorrows had an end,thy joys that i might see
o god,that i jerusalem,with speed may go behold
for why,the pleasures there abound,which here cannot be told
our pleasures are but pain,our joys not worth the looking on,our sorrows aye remain
thy joys when shall i see,the king sitting upon his throne,and thy felicity
fetch me thy fold unto,that all thy angels may rejoice,while all thy will i do
through me you pass into the city of woe,through me you pass into eternal pain,through me among the people lost for aye
justice the founder of my fabric moved,to rear me was the task of power divine,supremest wisdom and primeval love
besides when i this point concluded thus,by praying no defect could be supplied,because the prayer had none access to god

he seeks in vain for a prototype of his conception,blasted by his,disappointment he descends to an untimely grave
the good die first,and those whose hearts are dry as summer dust,burn to the socket
there was a youth who as with toil and travel,had grown quite weak and gray before his time,nor any could the restless griefs unravel
for nought of ill his heart could understand,but pity and wild sorrow for the same,not his the thirst for glory or command
for none than he a purer heart could have,or that loved good more for itself alone,of nought in heaven or earth was he the slave
he had a gentle yet aspiring mind,just innocent with varied learning fed,and such a glorious consolation find
his soul had wedded wisdom and her dower,is love and justice clothed in which he sate,apart from men as in a lonely tower
those false opinions which the harsh rich use,to blind the world they famish for their pride,nor did he hold from any man his dues
liberal he was of soul and frank of heart,and to his many friends all loved him well,whate'er he knew or felt he would impart
and mortal hate their thousand voices rose,they passed like aimless arrows from his ear,nor did his heart or mind its portal close
through which his soul like vesper's serene beam,piercing the chasms of ever rising clouds,shone softly burning though his lips did seem
were driven within him by some secret power,which bade them blaze and live and roll afar,like lights and sounds from haunted tower to tower
a mirror found he knew not none could know,but on whoe'er might question him he turned,the light of his frank eyes as if to show
the cause of his disquietude or shook,with spasms of silent passion or turned pale,so that his friends soon rarely undertook
that memories of an antenatal life,made this where now he dwelt a penal hell,and others said that such mysterious grief
by mortal fear or supernatural awe,and others ''tis the shadow of a dream,which the veiled eye of memory never saw
men held with one another nor did he,like one who labours with a human woe,decline this talk: as if its theme might be
with soul-sustaining songs and sweet debates,of ancient lore there fed his lonely being,the mind becomes that which it contemplates
was grass-grown and the unremembered tears,were dry in laian for their honoured chief,who fell in byzant pierced by moslem spears
and blighting hope who with the news of death,struck body and soul as with a mortal blight,she saw between the chestnuts far beneath
and athanase her child who must have been,then three years old sate opposite and gazed,in patient silence
thus through his age dark cold and tempest-tossed,shone truth upon zonoras and he filled,from fountains pure nigh overgrown and lost
the youth as shadows on a grassy hill,outrun the winds that chase them soon outran,his teacher and did teach with native skill
so in the caverns of the forest green,or on the rocks of echoing ocean hoar,zonoras and prince athanase were seen
which pours beyond the sea one steadfast beam,whilst all the constellations of the sky,seemed reeling through the storm
and the far sighings of yon piny dale,made vocal by some wind we feel not here,i bear alone what nothing may avail
is faithful now the story of the feast,and agathon and diotima seemed,from death and dark forgetfulness released
loves then the shade of his own soul half seen,in any mirror or the spring's young minions,the winged leaves amid the copses green
twas at this season that prince athanase,passed the white alps those eagle-baffling mountains,slept in their shrouds of snow beside the ways
which clanged along the mountain's marble brow,warped into adamantine fretwork hung,and filled with frozen light the chasms below
catch thee and feed from their o'erflowing bowls,thousands who thirst for thine ambrosial dew,thou art the radiance which where ocean rolls
in spring which moves the unawakened forest,clothing with leaves its branches bare and bleak,thou floatest among men and aye implorest
trembling in drops on the discoloured skin,of those who love their kind and therefore perish,in ghastly torture a sweet medicine

had kept as wakeful as the stars that gem,the cone of night now they were laid asleep,stretched my faint limbs beneath the hoary stem
was so transparent that the scene came through,as clear as when a veil of light is drawn,o'er evening hills they glimmer and i knew
as in that trance of wondrous thought i lay,this was the tenour of my waking dream,methought i sate beside a public way
all hastening onward yet none seemed to know,whither he went or whence he came or why,he made one of the multitude and so
and others as with steps towards the tomb,pored on the trodden worms that crawled beneath,and others mournfully within the gloom
but more with motions which each other crossed,pursued or shunned the shadows the clouds threw,or birds within the noonday aether lost
upon that path where flowers never grew,and weary with vain toil and faint for thirst,heard not the fountains whose melodious dew
with overarching elms and caverns cold,and violet banks where sweet dreams brood but they,pursued their serious folly as of old
so came a chariot on the silent storm,of its own rushing splendour and a shape,so sate within as one whom years deform
speed in the van and blindness in the rear,nor then avail the beams that quench the sun,or that with banded eyes could pierce the sphere
the crowd gave way and i arose aghast,or seemed to rise so mighty was the trance,and saw like clouds upon the thunder-blast
by action or by suffering and whose hour,was drained to its last sand in weal or woe,so that the trunk survived both fruit and flower
fled back like eagles to their native noon,or those who put aside the diadem,of earthly thrones or gems
was soothed by mischief since the world begun,throw back their heads and loose their streaming hair,and in their dance round her who dims the sun
kindle invisibly and as they glow,like moths by light attracted and repelled,oft to their bright destruction come and go
yet ere i can say where the chariot hath,passed over them nor other trace i find,but as of foam after the ocean's wrath
and follow in the dance with limbs decayed,seeking to reach the light which leaves them still,farther behind and deeper in the shade
that what i thought was an old root which grew,to strange distortion out of the hill side,was indeed one of those deluded crew
i will unfold that which to this deep scorn,led me and my companions and relate,the progress of the pageant since the morn
taught them not this to know themselves their might,could not repress the mystery within,and for the morn of truth they feigned deep night
without the opportunity which bore,him on its eagle pinions to the peak,from which a thousand climbers have before
that every pigmy kicked it as it lay,and much i grieved to think how power and will,in opposition rule our mortal day
frederick and paul catherine and leopold,and hoary anarchs demagogues and sage,names which the world thinks always old
and life where long that flower of heaven grew not,conquered that heart by love which gold or pain,or age or sloth or slavery could subdue not
the other long outlived both woes and wars,throned in the thoughts of men and still had kept,the jealous key of truth's eternal doors
had founded many a sceptre-bearing line,and spread the plague of gold and blood abroad,and gregory and john and men divine
for the true sun it quenched 'their power was given,but to destroy ' replied the leader: 'i,am one of those who have created even

though it was now broad day a gentle trace,of light diviner than the common sun,sheds on the common earth and all the place
burned on the waters of the well that glowed,like gold and threaded all the forest's maze,with winding paths of emerald fire there stood
a shape all light which with one hand did fling,dew on the earth as if she were the dawn,and the invisible rain did ever sing
of the deep cavern and with palms so tender,their tread broke not the mirror of its billow,glided along the river and did bend her
as one enamoured is upborne in dream,o'er lily-paven lakes mid silver mist,to wondrous music so this shape might seem
of leaves and winds and waves and birds and bees,and falling drops moved in a measure new,yet sweet as on the summer evening breeze
and still her feet no less than the sweet tune,to which they moved seemed as they moved to blot,the thoughts of him who gazed on them and soon
of darkness re-illumine even the least,of heaven's living eyes like day she came,making the night a dream and ere she ceased
into this valley of perpetual dream,show whence i came and where i am and why,pass not away upon the passing stream
where the first wave had more than half erased,the track of deer on desert labrador,whilst the wolf from which they fled amazed
and the fair shape waned in the coming light,as veil by veil the silent splendour drops,from lucifer amid the chrysolite
or the soft note in which his dear lament,the brescian shepherd breathes or the caress,that turned his weary slumber to content
more dimly than a day-appearing dream,the host of a forgotten form of sleep,a light of heaven whose half-extinguished beam
the forest and as if from some dread war,triumphantly returning the loud million,fiercely extolled the fortune of her star
and underneath aethereal glory clad,the wilderness and far before her flew,the tempest of the splendour which forbade
others stood gazing till within the shade,of the great mountain its light left them dim,others outspeeded it and others made
the chariot and the captives fettered there,but all like bubbles on an eddying flood,fell into the same track at last and were
the thickest billows of that living storm,i plunged and bared my bosom to the clime,of that cold light whose airs too soon deform
of him who from the lowest depths of hell,through every paradise and through all glory,love led serene and who returned to tell
grew dense with shadows to its inmost covers,the earth was gray with phantoms and the air,was peopled with dim forms as when there hovers
phantoms diffused around and some did fling,shadows of shadows yet unlike themselves,behind them some like eaglets on the wing
of kingly mantles some across the tiar,of pontiffs sate like vultures others played,under the crown which girt with empire
of daemon wings and laughed from their dead eyes,to reassume the delegated power,arrayed in which those worms did monarchize
and others like discoloured flakes of snow,on fairest bosoms and the sunniest hair,fell and were melted by the youthful glow
of her last cub glared ere it died each one,of that great crowd sent forth incessantly,these shadows numerous as the dead leaves blown
obscure clouds moulded by the casual air,and of this stuff the car's creative ray,wrought all the busy phantoms that were there
and fell as i have fallen by the wayside,those soonest from whose forms most shadows passed,and least of strength and beauty did abide
out of the eastern shadow of the earth,amid the clouds upon its margin gray,scattered by night to swathe in its bright birth

and fleet-foot fear from rolling orbs perceived,steadfast unharmed a stooping shepherd-boy,frowning upon the target of his face
he breathed and lost in dazzling darkness prayed,besought his reins his gloating gods his youth,and turned to smite what he no more could see
i could not view his fatness for his soul,which peeped like harmless lightnings and was gone,as haps to voyagers of the summer air
lord,sighed his aspect weeping o'er the jest,what simple mouse brought such a mountain forth
beauty she sighs o'er and she sighs o'er gold,gold will buy all things even a sweet husband,else only heaven is left and farewell youth
surely if some young flowers of spring were put,into the tender hollow of her heart,twould faintly answer trembling in their petals
he moves small fingers much and all his speech,is like a sampler of precisest words,set in the pattern of a simpleton
and when amid startled birds she sings lament,mocking in hope the long voice of the stream,it seems her heart's lute hath a broken string
better be out of sight of peering eyes,out out of hearing of all-useless words,spoken of tedious tongues in heedless ears
and lest at last the world should learn heart-secrets,lest that sweet wolf from some dim thicket steal,better the glassy horror of the stream
darkness gave birth to the all-trembling stars,and a far roar of long-drawn cataracts,flooding immeasurable night with sound
the roar of london is the roar of ire,the lion utters in his old desire,for libya out of dim captivity
and the deep wonder of her starry eyes,seemingly lost in cloudless paradise,and all earth's sorrow out of memory gone
no breast wherein,to chase away,that watchful shape
vain vain to say,haunt not with night,the day
a blotted page,from that clear little book life's taken away,how could i read it dear so dark the day
over and over again,martha would tell us her stories,in the hazel glen
like a dream you dream in the night,fairies and gnomes stole out,in the leaf-green light
but when the sweet moon comes,showering her silver down,they droop where they have blown
no voice is audible,the wind,sleeps in its peace
of stars that strangely stir,smitten to fire by the sandals of him,who walks with her
the fire-flames crooned a tiny song,no cold wind moved the wintry tree,beside their mother's knee
and from her leafy night-hung nook,upon this stranger soft did look,the nightingale: sighed he
thus then these two small birds perched there,breathed a strange riddle both did share,yet neither could expound
and we who sing but as we can,in the small knowledge of a man,have we an answer found
so stand i here my woes entreating,in this dark alley lest the moon,point with her sparkling my barbed armoury
step very softly sweet quiet-foot,stumble not whisper not smile not,by this dark ivy stoop cheek and brow
think,in time's smallest clock's minutest beat,might there not rest be found for wandering feet
no no,nor earth nor air nor fire nor deep,could lull poor mortal longingness asleep
thus have they told me,and i come,as flies the wounded wild-bird home
silence,still faint on the porch,brake the flames of the stars
she will not die they say,she will but put her beauty by,and hie away
oh but her beauty gone how lonely,then will seem all reverie,how black to me
all things will sad be made,and every hope a memory,all gladness dead
ghosts of the past will know,my weakest hour and whisper to me,and coldly go
and hers in deep of sleep,clothed in its mortal beauty i shall see,and waking weep
naught will my mind then find,in man's false heaven my peace to be,all blind and blind
and none lifts a hand to withhold,a friend from the touch of that foe,heart cries unto heart thou art old
there now,death goes,mayhap i've wearied him
come love my lad,nodding that drowsy head,tis time thy prayers were said
even the gods must feel,a smarting of the eyes,as these fumes upsweal
while the shape who hoofs applause,behind our deafened ear,hoots angel-wise the cause
heavenly archer bend thy bow,now the flame of life burns low,youth is gone i too would go
even fortune leads to this,harsh or kind at last she is,murderess of all ecstasies
yet the spirit dark alone,bound in sense still hearkens on,for tidings of a bliss foregone

ah captain,here goes for a fine-drawn bead,there's music around when my barrel's in tune
crack,went the rifle the messenger sped,and dead from his horse fell the ringing dragoon
strangle the fool that dares to scoff,attention,it's his way
quick step,we're with him before morn,that's stonewall jackson's way
charge stuart,pay off ashby's score,in stonewall jackson's way
ah maiden,wait and watch and yearn,for news of stonewall's band
ah widow,read with eyes that burn,that ring upon thy hand
honor to her,and let a tear,fall for her sake on stonewall's bier
one look to heaven,no thoughts of home,the guidons that we bear are dearer
cling,clang,forward all
breathe a prayer but no sigh think for what you would fight,then charge,with a will boys and god for the right
how he strode his brown steed,how we saw his blade brighten,in the one hand still left and the reins in his teeth
what to him is friend or foeman,rise of moon or set of sun,hand of man or kiss of woman
what cares he,he cannot know,lay him low
at last from out the centre fight,spurred up a general's aide,that battery must silenced be
when midst the storm of shell,our leader with his sword upraised,beneath our bayonets fell
up,up the hill we followed bill,and we captured every gun
by heavens,the foemen may track me in blood,for this hole in my breast is outpouring a flood
no,no surgeon for me he can give me no aid,the surgeon i want is pickaxe and spade
but we stood did we not,like immovable rock,unheeding their balls and repelling their shock
did you mind the loud cry,when as turning to fly,our men sprang upon them determined to die
great heavens,this bullet-hole gapes like a grave,a curse on the aim of the traitorous knave
here morris old fellow get hold of my hand,and wilson my comrade o wasn't it grand,when they came down the hill like a thunder-charged cloud
where's wilson my comrade,here stoop down your head,can't you say a short prayer for the dying and dead
confusion to traitors,keep hold of my hand,and float the old flag o'er a prosperous land
impatient to be where the battle-field calls,every nerve of the charger was strained to full play,with sheridan only ten miles away
what was it a dream,am i all alone,in the dreary night and the drizzling rain
hist,ah it was only the river's moan,they have left me behind with the mangled slain
we met from the battling ranks apart,together our weapons hashed and fell,and mine was sheathed in his quivering heart
my brother,would i had died for thee,this burden is more than my soul can bear
yea it was noblest for him it was best,there to pass over the river and rest,under the shade of the trees
our spirits high with new emprise,ambitious of each exercise,and glowing with a martial thirst
athwart the gloom the lightning flashed,and through the cloud some horsemen dashed,and from the heights the thunder pealed
a khamsin wind that scorched and singed,like that infernal flame that fringed,the british squares at waterloo
virginia cried to tennessee,we two together come what may,shall stand upon these works to-day
the tattered standards of the south,were shrivelled at the cannon's mouth,and all her hopes were desolate
in vain virginia charged and raged,a tigress in her wrath uncaged,till all the hill was red and wet
the brave went down,without disgrace,they leaped to ruin's red embrace
they only heard fame's thunders wake,and saw the dazzling sun-burst break,in smiles on glory's bloody face
they smote and fell who set the bars,against the progress of the stars,and stayed the march of motherland
they smote and stood who held the hope,of nations on that slippery slope,amid the cheers of christendom
god lives,he forged the iron will,that clutched and held that trembling hill
a mighty mother turns in tears,the pages of her battle years,lamenting all her fallen sons
follow me,steady,we'll save the day
this was what he seemed to say,and to the light of his glorious eye,the bold brigades thus made reply
we'll go forward but you must go back,and they moved not an inch in the perilous track,go to the rear and we'll send them to hell
touch it not unfold it never,let it droop there furled forever,for its people's hopes are fled
look within,there's an empty stall,where once stood a charger and that is all
all,o god,it is all i can speak
question me not i am old and weak,his sabre and his saddle hang on the wall,and his horse pined to death i have told you all
a cheer and salute for the admiral and here's to the captain bold,and never forget the commodore's debt when the deeds of might are,told
now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths,our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,our dreadful marches to delightful measures
o son of peace,the giant cried thy fate,is sealed at last and love shall yield to hate
the unarmed buddha looking with no trace,of fear or anger in the monster's face,in pity said poor fiend even thee i love
and the red sparks lit the air,not alone for the blade was the bright steel made,and he fashioned the first ploughshare
our stanch good friend is he,and for the ploughshare and the plough,to him our praise shall be
where may the grave of that good man be,by the side of a spring on the breast of helvellyn,under the twigs of a young birch-tree
but what are the deeds of to-day,in the days of the years we dwell in,that wear our lives away
there are three words to speak,we will it and what is the foeman,but the dream-strong wakened and weak
the lightnings may flash and the loud thunders rattle,he heeds not he hears not he's free from all pain,he sleeps his last sleep he has fought his last battle
alas,they have perished in far hilly regions,and all save the fame of their triumph is gone
though nations may combat and war's thunders rattle,no more on the steed wilt thou sweep o'er the plain,thou sleep'st thy last sleep thou hast fought thy last battle
nay nay my little girl,quoth he,it was a famous victory
watch that they spread where english blood is spilt,lest mixed and sullied with his country's guilt,the soldier's life-stream flow and heaven displease
two swords there are: one naked apt to smite,thy blade of war and battle-storied one,rejoices in the sheath and hides from light
their shivered swords are red with rust,their haughty banner trailed in dust,is now their martial shroud
ah,what a sound will rise how wild and dreary,when the death-angel touches those swift keys
the soldiers' guard was brief,whilst right is right and wrong is wrong,ye may not seek relief
there is no holier spot of ground,than where defeated valor lies,by mourning beauty crowned
waiting the judgment-day,wet with the rain the blue,wet with the rain the gray

why they gave him turbans red,to adorn his hairless head,and knitted jaunty nightcaps to protect him when abed
in vain the rest demurred,not a single chiding word,those ladies deigned to tolerate remonstrance was absurd
then the other members said,gott im himmel,what a head
and this wonderment increased,till the sympathetic priest,inquired of those same ladies: why this fuss about deceased
whereupon were they appalled,for as one those women squalled,we doted on deceased for being bald bald bald

they were the boys and they the girls who shared my youthful play,they do not answer to my call,my playmates where are they
o cottage 'neath the maples have you seen those girls and boys,that but a little while ago made oh,such pleasant noise
there's store of wealth,and more of health,in every glass we think
and from the bowl,no genial soul,in such an hour can shrink
and from the bowl,no genial soul,in such an hour will shrink
there's fellowship,in every sip,of friendship's brew we think
and when they saw that cunning little mite,they cried in a chorus expressive of delight,what a cute little boy
why a cute little boy,a funny little boy,a dear little bow-leg boy
now some might suppose that that beautiful bird,performed for her babies the music they heard,for the folk in the little straw parlor don't you
she thought silly girl,t was a beau come to woo,but i guess it was only the cricket don't you

with togas battle axes shields we made a dazzling show,when we were roman soldiers with brutus in st,jo
for love of art not lust for gold consumed us years ago,when we were roman soldiers with brutus in st,jo
my lips were sealed but that it seems quite proper you should know,that rome was nowhere in it at philippi in st,jo
and after all my suffering it were not hard to show,that i got my allopathic dose with brutus at st,jo
oh yes i travelled far and fast that night and i can show,the scars of honest wounds i got with brutus in st,jo
by which you see that public taste has fallen mighty low,since we fought as roman soldiers with brutus in st,jo

so it was peter,all day calling reminding and chiding,peter neglected his work therefore that nagging at peter
nor is it stated or guessed what was the trend of those volumes,what thing soever it was done with a pen and a pencil,wrought with a brain not a hoe surely 't was hostile to farming
fudge on all readin,they quoth or that's what's the ruin of,peter
peter derided these things held in such faith by the farmer,scouted at magic and charms hooted at jonahs and hoodoos,thinking and reading of books must have unsettled his reason
surely enough he went out into the damp of the morning,into the smudge that the witch spread over woodland and meadow,into the fleecy gray pall brooding on hillside and valley
laughing and scoffing he strode into that hideous vapor,just as he said he would do just as he bantered and threatened,ere they could fasten the door peter had done gone and done it
wasting his time over books you see had unsettled his reason,soddened his callow young brain with semi-pubescent paresis,and his neglect of his chores hastened this evil condition
this is the legend of old told in the tum-titty meter,which the great poets prefer being less labor than rhyming,nor have i further to say for the sad story is ended
of deep humiliation for the sullen hired-girl,of grief for mother hating to see things wasted so,and of fortune for that little boy who pined to taste that dough
it looked so sweet and yellow sure to taste it were no sin,but oh,how sister scolded if he stuck his finger in
but oh,how should i hail the death,that brings that vinous grace to me
but pretty girls and nice young men,observe a proper silence when,i chose to sing my lyrics to 'em

false path,it cost me priceless years of life,my well-beloved friend
o shame,they said such music is not meet,go up like ganymede
alas,though ne'er for me those eagle wings,stooped from their eyry proud
but strain to reach it ay with wrestlings stout,and hopes that even in the dark will grow,and ploddings wary and slow
and can i see this light,it may be so,but see it thus and thus my fathers said
if god indeed kept secret couldst thou know,or follow up the mighty artisan,unless he willed it so
that which i know and that which i divine,alas,have left thee out
i have aspired to know the might of god,as if the story of his love was furled,nor sacred foot the grasses e'er had trod
o man with eyes majestic after death,whose feet have toiled along our pathways rough,whose lips drawn human breath
when i looked i dared not sigh: in the light of god's splendor,with his daily blue and gold who am i,what am i
on that sultry august eve trouble had made me meek,i was tired of my sorrow o so faint for it was double,in the weight of its oppression that i could not speak
with that he spread his white wings and swept across the water,lit upon the hooded head and it and all went down,and they laughed as they went under and i woke the old man's daughter
o to be at least a cloud that near thee i might flow,solemnly approach the mountain weep away my being o'er thee,and veil thy breast with icicles and thy brow with snow
m,i'm hearty lass but warm the weather's warm,i think 'tis mostly warm on market days
m,all but this pat that i put by for george,he always loved my butter
c,but i want one to play with o i want,a little yellow duck to take to bed
f,now granny if you'll hold the babe awhile,tis time i took up willie to his crib
george,well mother 'tis a fortnight now or more,since i set eyes on you
g,were not proud of them,eh mother
m,i set store by mine 'tis true,but then i had good cause
f,no he got his voice from you,do use it george and send the child to sleep
g,ay of the purple grapes and crimson leaves,but mother put your shawl and bonnet off
and frances lass i brought some cresses in,just wash them toast the bacon break some eggs,and let's to supper shortly
oft have i wooed sweet lettice white,by daylight and by candlelight,when we two were apart
some better day come on apace,and let me tell her face to face,maiden thou hast my heart
how gently rock yon poplars high,against the reach of primrose sky,with heaven's pale candles stored
she sees them all sweet lettice white,i'll e'en go sit again to-night,beside her ironing-board
turn back the cradle-quilt and lay him in,and mother will you please to draw your chair,the supper's ready
yet had i but the past she cries,and it was lost i would arise,and comfort me some other wise
we had a message long ago,that like a river peace should flow,and eden bloom again below
that was the last hill of the chain,and fair below i saw the plain,that seemed cold cheer to reprimand
half-drowned in sleepy peace it lay,as satiate with the boundless play,of sunshine in its green array
i looked my thought would make its way,fair is your child of face and limb,the round blue eyes full sweetly shine
a twelvemonths' child was at her side,whose infant may that be, i cried
she rose amazed but cursed me too,she could not hold such luck for true,but gave him soon with small ado
master good e'en to ye,a woodman said,who the low hedge was trimming with his shears
in sooth a lyre,and as the soft air played,those branches stirred but did not disunite
light it old sun wet it thou common dew,that 'neath men's feet its image still may be,while yet it waves above them living lyre like thee
only a passing mist the heaven o'ershrouds,it breaks it parts it drifts like scattered spars,what lies behind it but the nightly stars
gone,said the poet and about to be,forgotten: o how sad a fate is hers
ah,turret clock  i would thy hand,were hid behind yon towering maple-trees
and had he friends,one friend perhaps said he,but for the rest i pray you let it be
i will not speak i will not speak to thee,my star,and soon to be my lost lost star
but shortly as there comes to most of us,there came to him the need to quit his home,to tell you why were simply hazardous
peace peace,he cried i lost thee but in truth,there are worse losses than the loss of youth
adieu,the poet said my vanished star,thy duty and thy happiness were one
although he was her friend: but still that day,where elm and hornbeam spread a towering dome,she crossed the dells to her ancestral home
love cannot cool the burning austral sand,nor show the secret waters that lie hid,in arid valleys of that desert land
silent they rest in solemn salvatory,sealed from the moth and the owl and the flitter-mouse,each with his name on his brow
all the kings of the nations lie in glory,every one in his own house,then why not thou
that i bring thee guard it long,hide the light from buried eyes,hide it lest the dead arise
no more need,o mad mistake,with repentance in its wake
what change has made the pastures sweet,and reached the daisies at my feet,and cloud that wears a golden hem
this lovely world the hills the sward,they all look fresh as if our lord,but yesterday had finished them
and here's the field with light aglow,how fresh its boundary lime-trees show,and how its wet leaves trembling shine
between their trunks come through to me,the morning sparkles of the sea,below the level browsing line
i see the pool more clear by half,than pools where other waters laugh,up at the breasts of coot and rail
there as she passed it on her way,i saw reflected yesterday,a maiden with a milking-pail
but high she held her comely head,i cannot heed it now she said,for carrying of the milking-pail
from the clear pool her face had fled,it rested on my heart instead,reflected when the maid was gone
with happy youth and work content,so sweet and stately on she went,right careless of the untold tale
each step she took i loved her more,and followed to her dairy door,the maiden with the milking-pail
fair shine the blue that o'er her spreads,green be the pastures where she treads,the maiden with the milking-pail
and let alighting jackdaws fleet,adown it open-winged and pass,till they could touch with outstretched feet
she had not feared as i divine,because she had not hoped,alas
the sorrow of it,for that sign,came but to pass
red rocks that under waters show,blue reaches and a sailing skiff,were spread below
ah,why to that which needs it not,methought should costly things be given
sure home is best, the son replied,i have no home
the perfect face and shed on it,a charm half feeling half surprise,and brim with dreams the exquisite
and o for once let me complain,i must forego life's better part,man's dearer gain
robbed robbed of life's illusions sweet,and passion fainting at her feet,to wake no more
i would for all my fealty,that i could be as much to you,as you to me
how he had said that he would fain,that life would at a stand remain,eternally
the well-contented heart be fed,ever as then and all the world,when sails were furled
then closer at her side reclined,the bold brown woman from afar,comes to me blind
it swept with thunderous noises loud,shaped like a curling snow-white cloud,or like a demon in a shroud
then bankes came downe with ruin and rout,then beaten foam flew round about,then all the mighty floods were out
thou didst thou didst my daughter deare,the waters laid thee at his doore,ere yet the early dawn was clear
thy pretty bairns in fast embrace,the lifted sun shone on thy face,downe drifted to thy dwelling-place
that flow strewed wrecks about the grass,that ebbe swept out the flocks to sea,a fatal ebbe and flow alas
lift,o lift thou lowering sky,an thou wilt thy gloom forego
lift,o lift thou lowering sky,an thou canst thy blue regain
m,no: e'en my solitude is not mine now,and if i be alone is ofttimes doubt
man dwells apart though not alone,he walks among his peers unread,the best of thoughts which he hath known
i wait for my story the birds cannot sing it,not one as he sits on the tree,the bells cannot ring it but long years o bring it
let the star-clusters glow,let the sweet waters flow,and cross quickly to me
ah my sailor make haste,for the time runs to waste,and my love lieth deep
heigh ho,daisies and buttercups,fair yellow daffodils stately and tall
o that an echo might wake,and waft one note of thy psalm to me,ere my heart-strings break
while swam the unshed tear,her prattlers little heeding,would murmur this bird with its carol clear
when the red clay was kneaden,and god made adam our father dear,sang to him thus in eden
ah,surely methought by these shouts upraised,some travellers are benighted
let the child from its rest be taken,for the captain doth weary for babe and for bride,waken madam waken
the daffodils were fair to see,they nodded lightly on the lea,persephone persephone
drawn nigh she deemed it fairer still,and stooped to gather by the rill,the daffodil the daffodil
o light light light,she cries farewell,the coal-black horses wait for me
demeter seeks her far and wide,and gloomy-browed doth ceaseless roam,from many a morn till eventide
my life immortal though it be,is nought she cries for want of thee,persephone persephone
fade fade and droop o lilied lea,where thou dear heart wert reft from me,persephone persephone
or seated on the elysian hill,she dreams of earthly daylight still,and murmurs of the daffodil
the tender corn upon the lea,droops in her goddess gloom when she,cries for her lost persephone
arise and set the maiden free,why should the world such sorrow dree,by reason of persephone
the gates of hades set her free,she will return full soon saith he,my wife my wife persephone
her lips reply without her will,as one addressed who slumbereth still,the daffodil the daffodil
calm queen of hades art thou she,who stepped so lightly on the lea,persephone persephone
come over come home,through the salt sea foam,my sailor my sailor boy
yet come to me home,through the salt sea foam,for the greek must ask elsewhere
many lands they look to me,one of these might be wanting a prince as well,but that's as hereafter may be
she raised her white head,and laughed and she said,that's as hereafter may be
ay ay sir,quoth the fisherman,have done
he cried and then i rolled the rubbish out,more loudly than the meaning warranted,to air my lungs i thought not on the words
then said the fisherman who missed the point,so mike rolls out the psalm you'll hear him sir,please god you live till sunday
even so,and you too fisherman for here they say,you are all church-goers
ay sir and when he was a younger man,he went out in the lifeboat very oft,before the 'grace of sunderland' was wrecked
we too rose up (the crimson in the sky,flushing our faces) and went sauntering on,and thought to reach our lodging by the cliff
and rent with many a crevice where the wind,had laid up drifts of empty eggshells swept,from the bare berths of gulls and guillemots
i charge you mothers,by the mother's milk,he drew and by his father god over all
see here,it is the night,it is the night
i think not fishermen i have not heard,such women curse,god's curse is curse enough
it is enough can such an one be here,yea here,o god forgive you fishermen
a little while it is a little while,a little while and i will comfort thee,i go away but i will come again
god save me i have been a sinful man,and save the lives of them that still can work,for they are good to me ay good to me
but she if any neighbors had come in,: if any neighbors had come in,they might have seen her crying on her knees
and sobbing 'lost lost lost, beating her breast,her breast forever pricked with cruel thorns
and her tears flow down,down to her lips her lips that kiss the print,of nails and love is like to break her heart
love and repentance for it still doth work,sore in her soul to think to think that she,even she did pierce the sacred sacred feet
and out in darkness with the fisherfolk,we passed and stumbled over mounds of moss,and heard but did not see the passing beck
a simple custom this i love it well,a carved betrothal and a pledge of truth,beneath the yew-trees sat our village youth
ah sweetest voice,how pensive were its tones,and how regretful its unconscious pause
ah would it might be so,i thought and stood,listening entranced among the underwood
my daughter my beloved be not you,like those same roses,o bewildering word
o woman,thou wert fashioned to beguile,so have all sages said all poets sung
she looked again as one that half afraid,would fain be certain of a doubtful thing,or one beseeching do not me upbraid
and then she trembled like the fluttering,of timid little birds and silent stood,no smile wherewith to mock my hardihood
i thought awhile then slumber came to me,and tangled all my fancy in her maze,and i was drifting on a raft at sea
the near all ocean and the far all haze,through the while polished water sharks did glide,and up in heaven i saw no stars to guide
the cleft was wide enough to let me through,i clambered out and felt the balmy breeze,and stepped on churchyard grasses wet with dew
her dreamy smile was very fair to see,and her two hands were folded to her breast,with somewhat held between them heedfully
o fast asleep,and yet methought she knew,and felt my nearness those shut eyelids through
o if this be,i said yet speak to me,i blame my very dream for cruelty
and sayest thou so,she sighed in murmurs sweet,i have nought else to give thee now mine own
when by the churchyard wicket standing still,i cast my eager eyes abroad to know,if change had touched the scenes of long ago
my eyes were dazzled with delightful tears,in sooth they were the last i ever shed,for with them fell the cherished dreams of years
i looked and on the wall above my head,over her seat there was a tablet placed,with one word only on the marble traced
when like shooting-stars the angels,to your couch at nightfall go,are their swift wings heard to rustle
of the valley where it grows,but the baby heart receiveth,more than it bestows
secure from cold hunger and weather stain,fixed in his right and born to good estate,from common ills set by and separate
god,cried the dreaming man right impiously,what have i done that these my sleep affray
god,said the phantom i appeal to thee,appoint thou me this man to be my prey
god,sighed the kneeling woman frail and old,i pray thee take me for the world is cold
her tale,the justice cried,a pauper's tale
and he took heart at this so low behest,and let the stoutness of his will prevail,demanding is't for her you break my rest
speak,though she kneel throughout the livelong night,and yet shall kneel between thee and the light
if thou obey'st a greater tell thy lord,that i have paid her wages,cry to him
he has not much against me,none can say,i have not paid her wages day by day
then,quoth the shade and he constrained said on,then she reproved curtseyed herself away
but yet and yet the dreaded questions came,and didst thou weigh the matter taking thought,upon her sober life and honest fame
i gave it he replied with gaze distraught,i gave it fiend the usual care i took,the usual pains i could not nearer look
she said she was not guilty,ay 'tis true,she said so but the poor are liars all
hear him,the phantom muttered hear this man,o changeless god upon the judgment throne
but what,nay verily nor wealth nor weal,from henceforth shall afford thy soul delight
what thought she on this woman,on her days,of toil or on the supperless night forlorn
with that she opened but for fear she cried,for lo,two angels one on either side
call me o call from this world troublesome,and let me see thy face,he answered come
i said she was a london woman sir,and a fine scholar but i never said,she knew about the songs
tell,there's nought to tell,only they snored o' nights and frighted us
ah,there be some hearts i wis,to which nothing comes amiss
cuckoo cuckoo,float anear in upper blue,art thou yet a prophet true
cry thou black prophetess,sit up awake,forebode and ban them through the desolate night
when i hear the waters fretting,when i see the chestnut letting,all her lovely blossom falter down i think alas the day
once with magical sweet singing,blackbirds set the woodland ringing,that awakes no more while april hours wear themselves away
what idless graced the twittering things,luxurious paddlings in the spray,and delicate lifting up of wings
he knew she did not love him but so long,as rivals were unknown to him he dwelt,at ease and did not find his love a pain
she said,i shall not live to see it but she did,little sickly face a wan thin face
with that they parted from their boy and lived,longing between his holidays and time,sped he grew on till he had eighteen years
i do not care that my one son should sleep,merely for keeping him in breath and wake,only to ride to cover
do laddie,quoth she faltering half in tears,are you not happy with us not content
but his arms,folding he sat and twisted up his mouth,with comical discomfiture
no,do ye laddie,quoth the dame and laughed
what then,he dwelt among them as of old,and taught his mouth to smile
she cared no whit if laurance went or stayed,but answered when he spoke and dropped her cheek,in her fair hand
madam,and muriel lifted up her face,and looked they looked into each other's eyes
all's done,you hear it muriel if you can,o sweet forgive me
but what was that to muriel though her peace,he would have purchased for her with all prayers,and costly passionate despairing tears
ay he was gone,and she whom he had wed,as muriel learned was sick was poor was sad
but when that other heard it is the end,his heart was sick and he as by a power,far stronger than himself was driven to her
reason rebelled against it but his will,required it of him with a craving strong,as life and passionate though hopeless pain
she when she saw his face considered him,full quietly let all excuses pass,not answered and considered yet again
remain,she said for there is something to be told,some words that you must hear
but were it best to weep for a dead wife,and let the sorrow spend and satisfy,itself with all expression and so end
how shall i do the rest,and he who felt,her inmost thought was silent even as she
the wife,considering it with deep and strange delight,forgot for once her babe and looked and learned
mercy,muriel cried,but laurance does not wish it
he knows you love him but he will not speak,no never,some men are such gentlemen
the dropping thorn makes white the grass o sweetest lass and sweetest,lass,come out and smell the ricks of hay adown the croft with me o
and thou my lass by morning's light wast all in white wast all in,white,and parson stood within the rails a-marrying me and thee o
yes and i saw thee start upon thy way,so sure that we should meet,upon our trysting-day
and even absence then to me was sweet,because it brought me time to brood,upon thy dearness in the solitude
i only saw the stars i could not see,the river and they seemed to lie,as far below as the other stars were high
i look on you trembling and think in the dark with my soul,how small is our place 'mid the kingdoms and nations of god,these are greater than we every one
and there falls a great fear and a dread cometh over that cries,o my hope,is there any mistake
did he speak,did i hear,did i listen aright if he spake
did i answer him duly,for surely i now am awake,if never i woke until now
for this is a world full of sorrow,keep watch o'er its dust else thy children for aye are undone,for this is a world where we die
i have felt it,go on while the world is asleep,golden islands fast moored in god's infinite deep
far she sought o'er wood and wold but found not aught to say,mounting lark nor mantling cloud would any counsel render,though sweetly she had carolled upon that morn of may
shy she sought the wooer's face and deemed the wooing mended,proper man he was good sooth and one would have his way,so the lass was made a wife and so the song was ended
and dove with the white breast,let me alone the dream is my own,and my heart is full of rest
my love with the true heart,to think i have come to this your home,and yet we are apart
my love,he stood at my right hand,his eyes were grave and sweet
till night rose over the bourne,the dove on the mast as we sailed fast,did mourn and mourn and mourn
and stirred the dens beneath,to see us eat of death,with all the scoffing heavens toward us bending
and the winged armies twain,their awful watch maintain,they mark the earth at rest with her great dead
peace,lo he lifts a priestly hand,and blesseth all the sons of men in every land
silence,o i had my day,margaret margaret
i stoop: within 'tis dark and still,but shadowy paths methinks there be,and lead they far into the hill
through foaming gulfs of yeasty spray,to yield it on a grassy hill,at the noon of day
and behold,there was music within and a song,and echoes did feed on the sweetness repeating it long
i opened the door of my heart,and behold,there was music within and a song
o the song,it came and went,went and came
i have not learned,half the lore whereto it yearned,half the magic that it meant
where's the danger,where's the cold,slippery danger up the steep
chirping bird and tumbling spray,light work laughter scent of hay,peace and echo where are they
o happy gladys,i rejoice with her,for gladys saw the island
but it was said we think it were not well,that little gladys should acquire a taste,for pleasure going about and needless change
and how my heart hushed down and shaded lies,just like the sea when low convenient clouds,come over and drink all its sparkles up
why gladys is a child she has not skill,to shut herself within her own small cell,and build the door up and to say 'poor me
quoth gladys cogitating they were kind,the words that woman spoke,she does not know
why did i envy them,that was not good,yet it began with my humility
child what art doing here,the woman said,what wilt thou of dame isis and her bairn
(ay ay we see thee breathing in thy shroud,pretty shroud all frilled and furbelowed,the air is dim with dust of spiced bones
but o good lord ' saith he 'when these are sick,i fear me lord this excellent workmanship,of thine is counted for a cumbrance then
so gladys set her feet upon the sand,while in the sunset glory died away,the peaks of that blest island
we always read when any fable ends,hence we may learn,a moral must be found
she moves atween the almond boughs and bends,one thick with bloom to look on it,o love
preserve to me my wealth i do not say,for that is wasted away,and much of it was cankered ere it went
no but i pray if it be not too late,open to me the gate,that i may find my babe when i am dead
hangs thick as a swarm of bees,or a clustering village street,foundationless built on the seas
for rain came down in the night,and thunder muttered full oft,but now the azure is bright
many times since we have met,for i hold the years in my heart,and all that was is yet
beautiful eyes and shall i see no more,the living thought when it would leap from them,and play in all its sweetness 'neath their lids
_quoth the cedar to the reeds and rushes,water-grass you know not what i do,know not of my storms nor of my hushes
breathe o wind and set our answer free,for we have no voice of you forsaken,for the cedar-tree
the lovely ladies flocked within,and still would each one say,good mercer be the ships come up
and they flocked to the shore amain,all over the hoe that livelong night,many stood out in the rain
now farther on in womanhood,she gently stands where once she stood,and sings from out her deeper heart
i will not think upon it,yet she was,o she was dear my dutiful dear child
one soweth nay but i will tell this out,the first fyte was the best i call it such,for now as some old song men think on it
i dwell where england narrows running north,and while our hay was cut came rumours up,humming and swarming round our heads like bees
let be ' and pushing past 'beshrew thy heart,bargain,nay
beside them scorched smoke-blackened weary leaned,men that had fed them dropped their tired arms,and dozed
then to our hearts valour crept home again,alva who did convert from our old faith,with many a black deed done for a white cause
o such a sight,o such a sight mine eyes,never shall you see more
all grey the sea and ghostly grey the ships,and after in the offing rocked our fleet,having lain quiet in the summer dark
let spain within a pike's length hear them bleat,delivering of their pretty talk in a tongue,whose meaning cries not for interpreter
and while i spoke their topsails friend and foe,glittered and there was noise of guns pale smoke,lagged after curdling on the sun-fleck'd main
who ever saw weakling white butterflies,chasing of gallant swans and charging them,and spitting at them long red streaks of flame
two of their caravels we sank and one,took,ere she could catch the wind when she rode free
some did tow,others that we had plagued disabled rent,many full heavily damaged made their berths
blood-red pillars of reek,they looked on that vast host and troubled it,as on th' egyptian host one looked of old
it failed and in regard of that same want,they thought it not convenient to pursue,their vessels farther
all being ready speed i home and lo,my rosamund that by the spaniard sat,upon a cushion'd settle book in hand
she held,her psalter and he his and slowly read,till he would stop her at the needed word
thy wife ' and there he stopped her and he took,and kissed her hand and show'd in 's own a ring,taking no heed of me no heed at all
and slowly slowly she betook herself,down the long hall in lowly wise she went,and made her moans
but when my girl was gone,i stood at fault th' occasion master'd me,belike it master'd him for both felt mute
for i bethought me i was yet an host,and he bethought him on the worthiness,of my first deeds
i will be brief,the days drag on,my soul forebodes her death my lonely age
the pear-trees looked on in their white and blue birds flash'd about,and they too were angry as oliver,were they eleven
a pity,a very great pity,one should be eleven
i knew about heaven,but this was the country of this,light blossom and piping and flashing of wings not at all
the ways will be long but the days will be long ' quoth the river,to me a long liver long long, quoth the river the river
shall i cross by the ferry to-morrow and come in my white,to that little low church,and will oliver meet me anon
schoolmaster,well sir we thought this end o' the room,was dark
child,i'm helping father,but father why d'you take such pains
mrs,smith,ay you may say that
mrs,t,but i'm right glad you came it pleases them
enter vicar wife various friends with violins and a flute,they come to a piano and one begins softly to tune his,violin while the vicar speaks
mrs,t,ay how they clap him
well may he not an organ pipe they blow,on sunday in the church is half so sweet,but he's a hard man

coming,not she,there comes her sweetheart though
mrs,j,well very well but what of fiddler sam
an honest man and ever pays his score,born in the parish old blind as a bat,and strangers sing before him 't is a shame
and i at our trysting stone,whereto i came down alone,was fain o' the wind's wild moan
laurie laurie lad make not wail,with a wiser lass ye'll sure prevail,for ye sing like a woodland nightingale
and there's no sense in it under the sun,for of three that woo i can take but one,so what's to be done what's to be done
there's no sense in it under the sun,and,of three that woo i can take but one
nay but take me home to the churning mill,when cherry boughs white on yon mounting hill,hang over the tufts o' the daffodil
wife,done,nothing love
either the thing has done itself or they,must undo,did they call for fiddler sam
they know the woods their groaning noises weird,they climb in trees that overhang the slow,deep mill-stream loved and feared
behold a ship,her wide yards score the sky,she sails a steel-blue sea
father dear father bid us now god-speed,we cannot choose but sail it thus befell,mother dear mother ' 'nay 't is all decreed
so on the mount christ's chosen three,unware that glory it did shroud,feared when they entered into the cloud
how guileless sweet by gift divine,how beautiful dear child was thine,spared all their grief of thee bereaven
winner who had not greatly striven,hurts of sin shall not thee soil,carking care thy beauty spoil
or of the morrow diffident,unconscious beautiful she stood,calm in young stainless maidenhood
the mystery of the world whose name is life,all-conquering wends,and works for aye with rest and cold at strife
yet such for aye divided from us are,as other galaxies that seem no more,than a little golden millet-seed afar
divided swarming down some flat lee shore,then risen while all the air that takes no word,tingles and trembles as with cries not heard
though time be as a moon upon the wane,who walk with faith far up the azure lift,oft hear her talk of lights to wax again
the woman before her lord,shall glory fling,the rolls aside time raze out triumphs past
such as can see,why should they doubt,the childhood of a race
i saw,once in that earth primeval once a face,a little face that yet i dream upon
and i could walk and went,led by the hand through a long mead at morn,bathed in a ravishing excess of light
awhile our feeding hearts all satisfied,took in the blue of one another's eyes,two dimpled creatures rose-lipped innocent
you're sure it was the queen,of course a crown,was on her and a spangly purple gown
here they were beggar children in the street,and the dove said they had the prettiest things,and wore their best frocks every day
o yes and lined with white,like swallow wings so soft so very light,fluttering about
oft as in a dream i see full fain,the bell-tower beautiful that i love well,a seemly cluster with her churches twain
ay gone,the soft deceptive echoes roll,away and faint into remoteness
or thus of old men feigned and then did fear,then straight crowd forth the great ones of the sky,in flashing flame at strife to reach more near
wait and desire it life waits not free there,to good to evil thy right perilous,all shall be fair and yet it is not fair
is it the many fall'n shall lift the land,the race the age,nay 't is the few that stand
i sought to look as in the light of one,returned,will this be strange to me that day
oh let her speak with her best eloquence,to me but not her first and her right rare,can equal what i may not take from hence
and here was little ledbury quaint withal,the forest felled her lair and sheltering place,she long time left in age pathetical
great oaks' methought as i drew near to gaze,were but of small account when these came down,drawn rough-hewn in to serve the tree-girt town
she leaned against the pillar and below,three almost babes her care she watched the while,with downcast lashes and a musing smile
her cheeks like winter apples red of hue,her glance aside,to whom her speech to me
farewell good dame,lost,oh my lady lost
lost lost and lost whenas the cross road flee,up tumbled hills on each for eyes attent,a carriage creepeth
thus with myself i spoke,a rough brick floor,made the place homely i would rest me there
hath the most high of all his host afar,one most supremely beautiful one best,dearest of all the flock one favourite star
his image given in part the children know,they love one first and best,it may be so
there are on fortune's errant foot can steal,can guide her blindfold in at their own doors,or dance elate upon her slippery wheel
courage,there are 'gainst hope can still advance,dowered with a sane a wise extravagance
a long-waking aye waking till a word,come from her coral mouth to be the true,sum of all good heart wanted ear hath heard
yet if alas,might love thy dolour be,dream dear heart dear and do not dream of me
store make in loving make o make mine art,more,yet i ask no ask no wished goal
that was the end,slow solemn growth of light,come what come will remains to me this night
it was the end with dew ordained to melt,how easily was learned how all too soon,not there not thereabout such maiden dwelt
unhappy love,and i of that great host,unhappy love who cry unhappy most
then saw her demon blush vesuvius try,then evil ghosts white from the awful prime,thrust up sharp peaks to tear the tender sky
the stroke of noon,the bell-bird,yes and no
a footstep near,i turned past likelihood,past hope before me on the bridge she stood
on moorish walls yet hung long dust each hand,the keys but not the might to use remain,is there such house in some blest land for me
a country conquered oft and long before,of generations aye ordained to win,if mine the power i will unlock the door
what did the crescent wane,yet man is more,and love achieves because to heaven akin
o life,to hear again that wandering bell,and hear it at thy feet estelle estelle
up to far osteroe and suderoe,the deep sea-floor lies strewn with spanish wrecks,o'er minted gold the fair-haired fishers go
in earlier days great carthage suffered bale,and reckless hands tore down the temple veil,and omar burned the alexandrian rolls
let me alone mine enemy let me alone,never a christian bell that dire thick gloom to hallow,or guide him shelterless succourless thrust from his own
on the wall his golden shield,dinted deep in battle field,when the host o' the khalif fled
gold to gold,long sunbeams flit,upward tremble and break on it
comes a day for glory famed,tidings brought the enemy shamed,fallen now is peace proclaimed
the foe upon them the foe afore and behind them,they fly with death at their heels fierce sun-rays blind them,riderless steeds affrighted tread down their ranks amain
now the valley mist doth break,shifting sparkles edge the lake,love lord master wake o wake
ay it is not thrust o' a spear,scorn of infidel eyes austere,but mine own fear is to fear
love ' she sigheth 'thou didst not well,listening to the white-witch fell,leaving her doth thee advance
fifty candles burn at his head and burn at his feet,a crown and royal apparel upon him lorn and lowly,and the cold hands stiff as horn by their cold palms meet
two days dead,is he dead,nay nay but is he living
the weary monks have ended their chantings manifold,the great door swings behind them night winds entrance giving,the candles flare and drip on him warm and he so cold
the pale queen's honour,a low laugh scathing and sereing,a mumbling as made by the dead in the tombs ye wot
braveth the dead this queen,hear it whoso hath hearing,i vowed by my love cold king but i loved thee not
then he heareth accents bland,seeth the queen's ring on his hand,and he riseth calmed withal
thou dost take thy good things first,then thou art cast into the worst,first the glory then the strife
as one reasoning with a child,all his speech): 'my wife,my fair
and his hand on her brown hair,trembles 'lady dost indeed,weigh the meaning of thy rede
soh,a pillar misty and grey,t is the white-witch in the way
shelter at the last a roof,wrought of ling (in their behoof,foresters that drive the deer
ay and ere the twilight fall,gather forest berries small,and nuts down beaten for a meal
list,about and around us wondrous sweet noises,laughter of little children and maids that dreaming be
speak dear child dear ' quoth the queen 'and mine own little son,father ' the small thing murmurs then all is ended,he starts from that passion of peace ay the dream is done
till a tower shall on thee frown,him that holds it show this ring,so farewell my lord the king
tis the whole world whereon they lie,the rocky pastures hung on high,shelve off upon an empty sky
sigismund hath ricked the hay,he sitteth at close o' a sultry day,under his mulberry boughs at ease
faint as the light of stars and wan,as snow at night when the moon is gone,it is the white-witch risen once more
the white-witch that tempted of yore,so utterly doth substance lack,you may breathe her nearer and breathe her back
soft her eyes her speech full clear,hail thou sigismund my fere,bargain with me yea or nay
yea the good be all thine own,for now will i advance thy day,and yet will leave the night alone
though the highest heaped on me,trouble yet the same should be,welcomer than weal from thee
sigismund show us the boy is he safe and his mother,sigismund, dreaming he falls into laughter and wakes
from roofs and oriels high women looked down,men maidens children and a fierce white sun,smote blinding splinters from all spears aslant
he raves,fool,thou'lt hear more of this anon
but none did question me,a beldame old,kind heedless of my sayings tended me
father and mother mother and father kind,so young so innocent had ye no ruth,no fear that ye did bring her to her doom
parted in hiding some other in thrall,father and mother mother and father kind,it may be yet ye know not this not all
but after pause i felt a hand let down,that rested kindly firmly a man's hand,upon my shoulder there was cheer in it
then took a key opened and crying 'delia,delia my sweetheart i am come i am come,i darted forward and he locked us in
but for that other while she stood appeased,for cruel parting past locked in mine arms,i had been glad expecting a good end
there was a day when to the wilderness,my great forerunner from his thrall sent forth,sad messengers demanding art thou he
how could i hold the power and want the will,or want the love,that pang was his and mine
one drew i to the opening on it set,my delia kneeled upon its arm laid mine,and prayed to god and prayed of her
truly unless my soul i would have bound,with false oaths difficult innumerous strong,way was not left me to get free
but now,said she i am happy i have seen the place,where i am going
pray you make haste,i know not haste he said,i was not fashioned to be thrall of time
the weird pathetic scarlet of day dawning,more kin to death of night than birth of morn,peered o'er yon hill bristling with spires of pine
i knew this man for him who spoke with me,letting me see my delia,i looked up
am i a fiend,no he was good to me,almost he placed his life in my hand
she is no mother of mine she slew my love,what answer,peace peace thou art hard on me
but god is greater than the church,i hope,he shall not for that he loved men lose god
i have no vision but where vision fails,faith cheers and truly truly there is need,the god of this world being so unkind
i cannot fathom them,there is not time,so quickly men condemned me to this cell
and now he knows i would believe e'en so,as pleaseth him an there was time to learn,or certitude of heart but time fails time
he knoweth also 't were a piteous thing,not to be sure of my love's welfare not,to see her happy and good in that new home
white ashes and a waft of vapour i,to flutter on before the winds,no no
and yet for ever ay my flesh shall hiss,and i shall hear 't,dreadful unbearable
i have waked long,and cannot hold my thoughts upon th' event,they slip they wander forth
you tremble alas and alas you heard bad news from the town,only one short half hour to tell it,my poor courage fails
and the time is come ronald knows nothing your father will go,as the shadow fades from its place will he and be seen no more,there 'll be time to think to-morrow and after but to-day no
now scarlet o look,overcoming the blue both lake and sky,while the waterfalls waver like smoke then leap in and are not
ah,here is your ring see i draw it off it must not be mine,put it on love if but for the moment and listen to me
you might give your name to my father's child, 'my father's name,ay
i clomb full high the belfry tower,up to yon arrow-slit up and away,i said 'let me look on my heart's fair flower
my care she knoweth not no nor the cause,white rose red rose about her hung,and i aloft with the doves and the daws
the pity of it,love's a rover,the last word said and all over
quoth the brown bee,in thy white wear,four thou art fair
but as for me,i ' quoth the bee,never am fair
the little ones care not,and i fare not,amiss with thee
ay thou full fain,in the soft rain,shalt sing again
a fair wife making her moan despised forsaken,her good days o'er,seven no more
to these,add thick espaliers where the bullfinch came,to strew much budding wealth and was not chid
an all-sufficient world,and as it seems an undiscovered world,so very few the folk that come to look
and so the world was sweet and it was strange,sweet as a bee-kiss to the crocus flower,surprising fresh direct but ever one
whate'er she wanted wanted all,o how,t was poignant her rich voice not like a bird's
could she not dwell content and let them be,that they might take their pleasure in the town,for no she was not poor witness the pence
but now,they closed the shops the wild clear voice was still,the beggars moved away where was their home
white as white butterflies that each one dons,her face their wide white wings to shade withal,many moon-daisies throng the water-spring
while couched in rising barley titlarks call,and bees alit upon their martagons,do hang a-murmuring a-murmuring
may be their plaint when we shall meet again,and make our peace with them the sea of life,find flowing full nor ought or lost or vain
shall the vague hint whereof all thought is rife,the sweet pathetic guess indeed come true,and things restored reach that great residue
to stay my pleading 'take me to church and give me my ring,you should have spoken before ' he had sighed when i prayed him so,for his heart was sick for himself and me and this bitter thing
but spare me the ending,i did not wait to be quite cast away,i left him asleep and the bare sun rising shone red on my gown
look back they must and show thee thy fair past,or choosing thy to-day they may but chant,as they behold
it may be god's first work is but to breathe,and fill the abysm with drifts of shining air,that slowly slowly curdle into worlds
go up go mark the whiteness of the snow thy,faith is not thy saviour not thy god,though faith waste fruitless down a desert old
then straightway flashes up athwart the words,and if i be a son i am very far,from my great father's house i am not clean
ay he shall come in truth to visit thee,and thou shalt mourn to him unclean unclean,but never more i will to have it so
from henceforth thou shalt learn that there is love,to long for pureness to desire a mount,of consecration it were good to scale
this that i bear what is it,me no less,it binds i cannot disenslave my soul
for even thus it is with them: the day,waxeth to wane anon and a long night,leaves the dark heart unsatisfied with stars
my want is god's desire to give he yearns,to add himself to life and so for aye,make it enough
hard lines it gives them cold and dirt abhorred,hunger and nakedness in lieu of love,and blows instead of care
with that his hand,he laid upon a latch and lifted it,looked in full quietly and entered straight
now in that town there was an ancient church,a minster of old days which these had turned,to parish uses: there the curate served
and when the verger gave he moved with him,toward the door distraught then shut him out,and locked himself within the church alone
my heart is darkened and unclean,ah me,to be a man and yet to tremble so
till the strong angels pitiless and stern,but to them loving ever sweep them in,by armsful to the unapproachable fold
i would fain,said he have heard some more,and wilt thou go
and straight the little child put forth his hand,and touched him,master master hush
the curate murmured when he came again,to himself and looked about him,this is strange
there lieth at my feet frail white and dead,the sometime beggar,he is happy now
there must be something wrong,look to it: let us mend our ways,farewell
a thought from his heart doth reach to hers,come down o lady,to me
behold him,with the flock he wons,along yon grassy lea
oh,well is me she saith when day,draws on to eventide
my shepherd lord,i see him not,but he will come again
while he slumbered who can answer for what dreams they may have brought,him,when at midnight all was still
father,mother,must you leave him on his bed but not to slumber
surely no,i will be silent in your soul is no reflection,of the care that burdens mine
is it so my little henry,are we set so far asunder,who were wont to be so near
be thou near each chastened spirit for its course and conflict nerving,let thy voice say father mother lo,thy treasures live above
then by one man's intercession standing clear from their transgression,father mother you shall meet them fairer than they were before,ay for ever evermore
let her rapt dreamy smile,the wondering heart beguile,that almost thinks to hear a calm contented sigh
what trance-like peace is shed,on her reclining head,and e'en on listless feet what languor of repose
hearing of that blest shore,she thinks on earth no more,contented to forego this wintry land
she has nor thought nor care,but to rest calmly there,and hold the snowdrops pale that blossom in her hand
the young lips seem to say,i have wept much to-day,and felt some bitter pains but they are over now
what is the world,it is a waiting place,where men put on their robes for that above
what is the new world,tis a father's face,beholden of his sons the face of love
o night of nights,o night,desired of man so long
the waits of heaven to hear,oh,what it must have been
then wilt thou wipe away our tears,and comfort in th' all-hallow'd spheres,them that weep now
calm lie the desert pools in a fair wilderness,wind-shaken moves the reed so moves his voice the soul,sick folk surprised of joy wax when they hear it whole
but what,his doom yet eating of that tree,had been immortal life of shame and sin
where yet th' immortalizing tree doth grow,he shall there meet us and once more reveal,the fruit of life where crime is not nor woe
men say we differ'd they speak amiss,this man and i were neighbors ever,i would have ventured my life for his
sheltered and safe under roses blown,_storm cannot touch me hail nor shower,where all alone i sit all alone
misty as dreams the moonbeam lyeth,the lady singeth the lady sigheth,is there no more no more no more
mercy is startled and fain would fly,but e'en as she turns her steps o'ertaking,he pleads with her mercy it is but i
thine like thus differs form and presence laid,it is the unseen shade which risen hath pressed,above all heights where feet olympian strayed
a cottager leaned whispering by her hives,telling the bees some news as they lit down,and entered one by one their waxen town
and they are days when drops a veil,a mist upon the distance past,and while we say to peace all hail
dark fell the skies when once belated,sad and sorrow-fated i missed the sun,but wake heart and sing for not in vain i waited
leave the garden walls where blow,apple-blossoms pink and low,ordered beds of tulips fine
who hath most he yearneth most,sure as seldom heretofore,somewhere of the gracious more
for fuel at the ebb yon fair expanse,is strewed with driftwood by the breaking wave,and in the sea is fish for sustenance
i will build up the entrance of the cave,and leave therein a window and a door,and here will dwell and leave it nevermore
and soothed him long until the storm was spent,and the last thunder peal had died away,and stars were out in all the firmament
then did he cease to moan and slumbering lay,while in the welcome silence pure and deep,the care-worn parents sweetly fell asleep
once to that cottage door,in happy days of yore,my little love made footprints in the snow
she was so glad of spring,she helped the birds to sing,i know she dwells there yet the rest i do not know
i think but cannot tell,i think she loved me well,and some dear fancy with my future twined
but i shall never know,hope faints and lets it go,that passionate want forbid to speak its mind
and that's the best of it all,and when she blushes my heart so yearns,that tears are ready to fall
in their cups on yonder lea,cowslips fold the brown bee's diet,so the moss enfoldeth thee
youth was a pleasant morning but ah,to think 'tis fled,sae lang lang syne quo' her mother i too was young
i'd bear the long hours through,thou should'st forget and my sad breast,the sorrows twain should rue
the ring was a world too fine,and would it had sunk in a forty-fathom sea,ere the morn that made it mine
reach me life's wine and gold,what is man's best all told,if thou thyself withhold sweet from thy throne
o my liege lady,and o my loved lady,and o my heart's lady come reign there alone
drop drop from the leaves of lign aloes,o honey-dew,drop from the tree
there is busy talk around me all about mine ears it hummeth,but the wooden wharves i look on and a dancing heaving buoy,for 'tis tidetime in the river and she cometh oh she cometh
bring her to to ship her lading brig or schooner sloop or lighter,with a pull'e haul'e pull'e haul'e yoy,heave hoy
what's the good though i be fair,for thou'lt never see me mair,man johnnie
fain would i thy small limbs fold,while the weary hours are told,little babe in cradle cold
long watchings leave behind them little trace,and yet how sweetly must the mornings pass,that bring that dreamy calmness to thy face
thy cheek is resting on thy hand thine eyes,are like twin violets but half unclosed,and quiet as the deeps in yonder skies
never more peacefully in love reposed,a mother's gaze upon her offspring dear,than thine upon the long far-stretching mere
it faded and she never saw it more,nor any human eye oh grief,oh woe
how could he be so late,and then hope fled,and disappointment darkened into dread
he journeyed on and as he neared the gate,he met with one to whom he named the maid,inquiring of her welfare and her state
thou also thou,must nobly do thy part,that honor leads thee on which holds back me
be not thy gratitude deceived,i know,thou think'st it is thy duty i will go
faultless and fair all in the moony light,as one ashamed she looked upon the ground,and her white raiment glistened in his sight
one year there was fulfilled of happiness,but o,it went so fast too fast away
the flowers sent forth their nightly odors faint,when in the darkness waiting he saw one,to whom he said how fareth my sweet saint
who answered she hath borne to you a son,then turning left him and the father said,god rain down blessings on his welcome head
woe and alas,the times of sorrow come,and make us doubt if we were ever glad
for sir though men be evil yet the deep,they dread and at the last will surely turn,to him and he long-suffering will forgive
he saith again: i pray thee woman peace,for thou wilt enter when that day appears,the fateful ship
then at the last i cried,if the unseen be silent i will speak,and certify my meaning to myself
did they not spend much gear to gather out,such as i tell of and for matching them,one with another for a thousand years
what harm then if there came of it a race,inferior in their wits and in their size,and well content to serve
my mother was full old when i was born,and that was in her youth,what think you sir
and they are proud against the king of heaven,they hope in course of ages they shall come,to be as strong as he
laugh,o my heart,i would the voice were stilled
then light and cry to him 'great king the son,of old methuselah thy son hath sent,to fetch the growing maids his children home
but will the voice think you forbear to chide,nor that unseen who calleth buffet thee,and drive thee on
the giant elephants be cunning folk,they lie in ambush and will draw men on,to follow then will turn and tread them down
i must sit joyless in my place bereft,as trees that suddenly have dropped their leaves,and dark as nights that have no moon
i know it quoth he and she said again,the elder learning thou wouldst pass hath sent,to fetch thee then he rose and followed her
i looked it was a dream let no man say,it was aught else,there so the fit goes by
sir and my daughters is it eventide,sooner than that saith old methuselah,let the vulture lay his beak to my green limbs
would he could steal from thee one secret more,the secret of thy youth,o envious god
we die,the words of old methuselah,and his prophecy are ended
cowards,i heard them winnow their great wings,they went to tell him but they came no more
behold  behold,the earth that i made green cries out to me,red with the costly blood of beauteous man
thus marked he glowing on the branched moss,those red rare moons and let his serpent eyes,consider them full subtly what be these
then egg-like cracked the glowing balls and forth,started black angels trampling hard to free,their fettered feet from out the smoking shell
and when he looked,the dragon cried thou newly-fashioned thing,of name unknown thy scorn becomes thee not
but the dragon left a-tremble called to him,from the nether kingdom certain of his friends,three whom he trusted councillors accursed
or i most miserable hold my life,over the airless bottomless gulf and bide,the buffetings of yonder shoreless sea
a spirit rose and spake,whereas in heaven is power is much to fear,for this admired country we have marred
what if thy slaves by thy consent should take,and bear thee on their wings above the earth,and suddenly let fall how soon 't were o'er
and while the sullen camels moved he spake,to him that led the last there are but two,of these my sons but where doth japhet ride
that i have looked to for my solacing,in the bitterness to come,my children dear
and is this mine,said he my son,mine own
so japhet said,sir i am young but of my mother straight,i will go ask a wife that this may be
tis not the manner of our kin to wed,so young,thou knowest it art thou not ashamed
for all did scorn her,nay they cried,o fool
o japhet well-beloved,and she rose up,and did restrain herself saying dost thou heed
japhet spoke,he said my father's slave and she replied,low drooping her fair head my master's son
nay but for mine,get hence,obey my words
japhet said o maid,sweet are thy words but what if i return,and all again be as it is to-day
though ye shall find it even as i had died,silent for any words i might have said,empty for any space i might have filled
then he rose,and put aside the curtains of the tent,to look upon his father's face and lo
then came a messenger while japhet sat,mournfully and he said the men of might,are willing let thy master youth appear
ye mighty ones,it hath been known to you these many days,how that for piety i am much famed
and satan answered nay you,be not wroth,yet true it is and yet not all the truth
thereat the great leader laughed for scorn,hold snake,if god be just there shall be reckoning days
turn now thy reason to the other side,and speak for that for as to justice snake,we would have none of it
should i forbear,that have been patient,i will not forbear
but yet ' saith he,repent and turn you,wherefore will ye die
turn then o turn while yet the enemy,untamed of man fatefully moans afar,for if ye will not turn the doom is near
then shall the crested wave make sport and beat,you mighty at your doors,will ye be wroth
repent and turn thee from thine evil ways,o son,and no more dare the wrath of love
they said a man or false or fanatic,may claim good audience if he fill our ears,with what is strange: and we would hear again
then one to japhet said,one called the cedar-tree dost thou too think,to reign upon our lands when we lie drowned
and he related to them all his ways,from the beginning: of the voice that called,moreover how the ship of doom was built
he then replied,what is thy thought,there is no miracle
but i have found another yea good sooth,the damsel will not tarry she will come,with all her slaves by sundown
and she said,comfort thy heart and eat: moreover know,how that thy great work even to-day is done
for this i make thee free,and now thyself,art loveliest in mine eyes i look and lo
with that,she answered let this woman sir find grace,and favor in your sight
but yet said he o yet,if there be respite for the terrible,the proud yea such as scorn thee and if not
and at his feet,the wives of his two other sons did kneel,and wring their hands
o is it come to this,he answered them,the door is shut
the quivering butterflies in companies,that slowly crept adown the sandy marge,like living crocus beds

this is not the place for an essay on the genius of sidney lanier,it is enough to call attention to some marked points,in his character and work
whitman is poetry's butcher,huge raw collops slashed from the rump,of poetry and never mind gristle  is what whitman feeds our souls with
as near as i can make it out whitman's argument seems to be that,because a prairie is wide therefore debauchery is admirable,and because the mississippi is long therefore every american is god

my gossip the owl  is it thou,that out of the leaves of the low-hanging bough,as i pass to the beach art stirred
oh what if a bound should be laid,to this bow-and-string tension of beauty and silence a-spring,to the bend of beauty the bow or the hold of silence the string
in my heart,is a motion made,tis a motion of dawn like a flicker of shade on shade
yet now the dew-drop now the morning gray,shall live their little lucid sober day,ere with the sun their souls exhale away
still-eyed and shadow-brow'd,steal off from yon far-drifting crowd,and come and brood upon the marsh with me
what the cloud doeth,the lord knoweth,the cloud knoweth not
what the artist doeth,the lord knoweth,knoweth the artist not
how poor how strange how wrong,to dream he wrote the little song,i made to him with love's unforced design
i work in freedom wild,but work as plays a little child,sure of the father self and love alone
inward and outward to northward and southward the beach-lines linger and curl,as a silver-wrought garment that clings to and follows,the firm sweet limbs of a girl
somehow my soul seems suddenly free,from the weighing of fate and the sad discussion of sin,by the length and the breadth and the sweep of the marshes of glynn
the midmorn empties you of men save me,speak to your lover meadows,none can hear
i lie as lies yon placid brandywine,holding the hills and heavens in my heart,for contemplation
woods and wet pillows,this was all,this ox
from here to where the louder passions dwell,green leagues of hilly separation roll,trade ends where yon far clover ridges swell
but oh not the hills of habersham,and oh not the valleys of hall,avail: i am fain for to water the plain
with one poor word they tell me all they know,whereat their stupid tongues to tease my pain,do drawl it o'er again and o'er again
then down he shot bounced airily along,the sward twitched in a grasshopper made song,midflight perched prinked and to his art again
sweet science this large riddle read me plain,how may the death of that dull insect be,the life of yon trim shakespeare on the tree
burn golden globes in leafy sky,my orange-planets: crimson i,will shine and shoot among the spheres
then he sounded and down came kinsmen and clansmen all,ten blows for ten tine on his back let fall,and reckon no stroke if the blood follow not at the bite of thong
they follow mad hamish afar up the crag toward the sea,and the lady cries: clansmen run for a fee,yon castle and lands to the two first hands that shall hook him and hold
fast hamish back from the brink,and ever she flies up the steep,and the clansmen pant and they sweat and they jostle and strain
when the last stroke fell then he moved him a pace down the height,and he held forth the child in the heartaching sight,of the mother and looked all pitiful grave as repenting a wrong
e'en when thou strivest there within art's sky,full calm thine image in our love doth lie,a motion glassed in a tranquillity
frowning the owl in the oak complained him,sore that the song of the robin restrained him,wrongly of slumber rudely of rest
and cannot you walk now,bah,don't hop
soul could'st thou bare thy breast,as yon red rose and dare the day,all clean and large and calm with velvet rest
to-day the woods are trembling through and through,with shimmering forms that flash before my view,then melt in green as dawn-stars melt in blue
i pray with mosses ferns and flowers shy,that hide like gentle nuns from human eye,to lift adoring perfumes to the sky
i hear faint bridal-sighs of brown and green,dying to silent hints of kisses keen,as far lights fringe into a pleasant sheen
i start at fragmentary whispers blown,from undertalks of leafy souls unknown,vague purports sweet of inarticulate tone
thus without theft i reap another's field,thus without tilth i house a wondrous yield,and heap my heart with quintuple crops concealed
scorning the slow reward of patient grain,he sowed his heart with hopes of swifter gain,then sat him down and waited for the rain
he sailed in borrowed ships of usury,a foolish jason on a treacherous sea,seeking the fleece and finding misery
lulled by smooth-rippling loans in idle trance,he lay content that unthrift circumstance,should plough for him the stony field of chance
yea gathering crops whose worth no man might tell,he staked his life on games of buy-and-sell,and turned each field into a gambler's hell
aye as each year declined,with bitter heart and ever-brooding mind,he mourned his fate unkind
then worn and gray and sick with deep unrest,he fled away into the oblivious west,unmourned unblest
o trade,o trade,would thou wert dead
swinehood hath no remedy,say many men and hasten by,clamping the nose and blinking the eye
but who said once in the lordly tone,man shall not live by bread alone,but all that cometh from the throne
does business mean `die you  live i,then `trade is trade' but sings a lie,tis only war grown miserly
if business is battle name it so,war-crimes less will shame it so,and widows less will blame it so
alas for the poor to have some part,in yon sweet living lands of art,makes problem not for head but heart
i am not overbold,i hold,full powers from nature manifold
the nymphs cold creatures of man's colder brain,chilled nature's streams till man's warm heart was fain,never to lave its love in them again
later a sweet voice `love thy neighbor' said,then first the bounds of neighborhood outspread,beyond all confines of old ethnic dread

alas when sighs are traders' lies,and heart's-ease eyes and violet eyes,are merchandise

nor time hath changed his hair to white,nor his dear love to spite,fair lady
and then the hautboy played and smiled,and sang like any large-eyed child,cool-hearted and all undefiled

howe'er thou turn'st wrong earth,still love's in sight,for we are taller than the breadth of night

oh would that i might divine,thy name beyond the zodiac sign,wherefrom our times-to-come descend
he called thee `sometime,change it friend,`now-time' sounds so much more fine
to thee,come i a poet hereward haply blown,from out another worldflower lately flown
thou canst not measure mistress nature's hair,not one sweet inch: nay if thy sight is sharp,would'st count the strings upon an angel's harp

`i saw true hell with mine own eye,true hell or light hath told a lie,true verily ' quoth stout sense
there while they stood in a green wood,and marvelled still on ill and good,came suddenly minister mind
`in the heart of sin doth hell begin,tis not below 'tis not above,it lieth within it lieth within
`fixed: follow me would'st thou but see,he weepeth under yon willow tree,fast chained to his corse ' quoth mind
there when they came mind suffered shame,`these be the same and not the same,a-wondering whispered mind
lo face by face two spirits pace,where the blissful willow waves above,one saith: `do me a friendly grace
`read me two dreams that linger long,dim as returns of old-time song,that flicker about the mind
`now strange ' quoth sense and `strange ' quoth mind,`we saw it and yet 'tis hard to find,but we saw it ' quoth sense and mind

nay if ye three o morn,o spring,o heart
should chant grave unisons of grief and love,ye could not mourn with more melodious art,than daily doth yon dim sequestered dove
i asked my heart to say,some word whose worth my love's devoir might pay,upon my lady's natal day
then said my heart to me,`learn from the rhyme that now shall come to thee,what fits thy love most lovingly
this gift that learning shows,for as a rhyme unto its rhyme-twin goes,i send a rose unto a rose
in four brief cycles round the punctual sun,has she old learning's latest daughter won,this grace this stature and this fruitful fame
one wing was feathered with facts of the uttermost past,and one with the dreams of a prophet and both sailed fast,and met where the sorrowful soul on the earth was cast
then that artist began in a lark's low circling to pass,and first he sang at the height of the top of the grass,a song of the herds that are born and die in the mass
but god was not angry nor ever confused his tongue,for not out of selfish nor impudent travail was wrung,the song of all men and all things that the all-lover sung
yet as `a ghost, his household cry,`he hath followed a ghost in flight
twixt this and dawn three hours my soul will smite,with prickly seconds or less tolerably,with dull-blade minutes flatwise slapping me
yea would i rode these mad contentious brawls,no damage taking from their if and how,nor no result save galloping to my dawn
my dawn,my dawn,how if it never break
come ye wild weeks since first this canvas drew,out of vexed palos ere the dawn was blue,o'er milky waves about the bows full-creaming

`life and song' is the fifth of a series of seven poems,published under the general heading of `street-cries,with the two stanzas following as an introduction
the remaining numbers of the series are:  `remonstrance,given in this volume  `the ship of earth'  `how love looked for hell,`tyranny'  `to richard wagner'  `a song of love
coleman's `corn' in `the atlantic monthly' aug,which since it consists of but four lines and is more like lanier's poem,than are the others may be quoted
dumas's `corn-shucking' and `the last ear of corn,both life-like pictures of plantation life in his,`the golden day and miscellaneous poems
paul hamilton hayne whose love of nature rivals lanier's,has an interesting poem entitled `muscadines' (`poems' boston,pp
these may be found either in gosse's `english lyrics' (d,appleton  co,new york) or in palgrave's `golden treasury of songs and lyrics
there is in early english literature a most interesting play,entitled `mary magdalene': see pollard's `english miracle plays,where extracts are given
- it is precisely this evil that ruskin has in mind i take it,when he condemns the commercial text buy in the cheapest market and sell,in the dearest and when he declares that competition is the law of death

the two lines may be translated: love is the physician of life,and next to our lord himself moreover it is the way that goes,straight to heaven
thomas carew has several rose-moralities as `the true beauty,beginning he that loves a rosy cheek and his exquisite,`red and white roses
rollicking robert herrick too draws his morals now advising the virgins,to make much of time as in his `gather ye rose-buds while ye may,now preaching a rarely pathetic sermon as in `to blossoms
what were ye born to be,an hour or half's delight,and so to bid good-night
twas pity nature brought ye forth,merely to show your worth,and lose you quite
much like this last piece in import and scarcely inferior to it in execution,is `my life is like the summer rose' of richard henry wilde,which is familiar to every one
paul hamilton hayne's `the red and the white rose,is an interesting dialogue which the author concludes by making the former,an earthly queen and the latter a heaven-bound votaress
the fact that jonson here translates a prose love-letter of philostratus,the greek sophist may detract from the originality but not the beauty,of his poem

it will be interesting and instructive to compare the tributes,to the mocking-bird with keats's `ode to a nightingale,shelley's `to a skylark' and wordsworth's `to the skylark
interesting books about mull and the hebrides are,johnson's `a journey to the hebrides' and robert buchanan's `the hebrid isles,instructive too is cummin's `around mull

in his introduction to ward's admirable selections from the english,poets matthew arnold critic and poet to whom allusion has already,been made says
the future of poetry is immense because in poetry where it is,worthy of its high destinies our race as time goes on will find an,ever surer and surer stay
but if we conceive thus highly of poetry we must also set our,standard for poetry high since poetry to be capable of fulfilling,such high destinies must be poetry of a high order of excellence
we venture to say on the contrary paradoxical as the remark may,appear that no poet has ever had to struggle with more unfavorable,circumstances than milton
the poem was published in  so that for at least twenty-six years,the poet was utilizing all the available resources of civilization and,scholarship to make himself more fit
blessings be on them and eternal praise,the poets who on earth have made us heirs,of truth and pure delight in heavenly lays

descend with broad-winged flight,the welcome the thrice-prayed for the most fair,the best-beloved night
shall i have naught that is fair,saith he,have naught but the bearded grain
o no,from that blue tent above,a hero's armor gleams
death with frosty hand and cold,plucks the old man by the beard,sorely sorely
he shall so hear the solemn hymn that death,has lifted up for all that he shall go,to his long resting-place without a tear
through the gray mist thrust up its shattered lance,and rocking on the cliff was left,the dark pine blasted bare and cleft
ye voices that arose,after the evening's close,and whispered to my restless heart repose
go breathe it in the ear,of all who doubt and fear,and say to them be of good cheer
ye sounds so low and calm,that in the groves of balm,seemed to me like an angel's psalm
go mingle yet once more,with the perpetual roar,of the pine forest dark and hoar
tongues of the dead not lost,but speaking from deaths frost,like fiery tongues at pentecost
glimmer as funeral lamps,amid the chills and damps,of the vast plain where death encamps
my deeds though manifold,no skald in song has told,no saga taught thee
o father,i hear the church-bells ring,o say what may it be
o father,i hear the sound of guns,o say what may it be
o father,i see a gleaming light,o say what may it be
o drooping souls whose destinies,are fraught with fear and pain,ye shall be loved again
many a lesson deep and long,thou hast been a generous giver,i can give thee but a song
how like quivering flames they start,when i fan the living embers,on the hearth-stone of my heart
that my spirit leans to thee,thou hast been a generous giver,take this idle song from me
but still above the noisy crowd,the beggar's cry is shrill and loud,until they say he calleth thee
ye that have eyes yet cannot see,in darkness and in misery,recall those mighty voices three
the battle of our life is brief,the alarm the struggle the relief,then sleep we side by side
thou whose locks outshine the sun,golden tresses wreathed in one,as the braided streamlets run
standing with reluctant feet,where the brook and river meet,womanhood and childhood fleet
gazing with a timid glance,on the brooklet's swift advance,on the river's broad expanse
deep and still that gliding stream,beautiful to thee must seem,as the river of a dream
then why pause with indecision,when bright angels in thy vision,beckon thee to fields elysian
seest thou shadows sailing by,as the dove with startled eye,sees the falcon's shadow fly
hearest thou voices on the shore,that our ears perceive no more,deafened by the cataract's roar
like the swell of some sweet tune,morning rises into noon,may glides onward into june
childhood is the bough where slumbered,birds and blossoms many-numbered,age that bough with snows encumbered
gather then each flower that grows,when the young heart overflows,to embalm that tent of snows
bear a lily in thy hand,gates of brass cannot withstand,one touch of that magic wand
bear through sorrow wrong and ruth,in thy heart the dew of youth,on thy lips the smile of truth
o that dew like balm shall steal,into wounds that cannot heal,even as sleep our eyes doth seal
and that smile like sunshine dart,into many a sunless heart,for a smile of god thou art
a tear stood in his bright blue eye,but still he answered with a sigh,excelsior
this was the peasant's last good-night,a voice replied far up the height,excelsior
he a negro and enslaved,sang of israel's victory,sang of zion bright and free
but alas,what holy angel,brings the slave this glad evangel
lara,you were not at the play tonight don carlos,how happened it
the house was crowded and the busy fans,among the gayly dressed and perfumed ladies,fluttered like butterflies among the flowers
lara,may not a saint fall from her paradise,and be no more a saint
don c,you forget,she is a gypsy girl
lara,and therefore won,the easier
the only virtue that a gypsy prizes,is chastity,that is her only virtue
lara,and does that prove,that preciosa is above suspicion
but why this haste,stay yet a little longer,and fight the battles of your dulcinea
fran,yes my lord,i saw him at the jeweller's to-day
fran,i saw him buy,a golden ring that had a ruby in it
fran,one so like it,i could not choose between them
and hark,what songs of love what soul-like sounds,answer them from below
prec,i am so frightened,t is for thee i tremble
prec,i heed them not,when thou art present i see none but thee
vict,there's nothing fair nor beautiful but takes,something from thee that makes it beautiful
prec,a grave and reverend cardinal and his grace,the archbishop of toledo
vict,what mad jest,is this
now viva la cachucha,it will breathe,the fire of youth into these gray old men
prec,dost thou remember,when first we met
dost thou still doubt,what i most prize in woman,is her affections not her intellect
compare me with the great men of the earth,what am i,why a pygmy among giants
but if thou lovest mark me,i say lovest,the greatest of thy sex excels thee not
prec,yes that i love thee as the good love heaven,but not that i am worthy of that heaven
prec,it is a hateful sound,to scare thee from me
and to remind thee of my love take this,a serpent emblem of eternity,a ruby say a drop of my heart's blood
vict,what convent of barefooted carmelites,taught thee so much theology
prec,hush,hush
bal,and a pitcher of pedro ximenes with a roasted pear in,it
hyp,i must have been asleep,ay sound asleep
vict,come shrive me straight for if love be a sin,i am the greatest sinner that doth live
vict,nay listen for my heart is full so full,that i must speak
hyp,and therefore in madrid when thou shouldst be,in alcala
vict,pray do not jest,this is no time for it
vict,they quarrelled,and so the matter ended
hyp,but in truth,thou wilt not marry her
i'll stoop for it but when i wear it here,set on my forehead like the morning star,the world may wonder but it will not laugh
hyp,if thou wear'st nothing else upon thy forehead,t will be indeed a wonder
hyp,which means in prose,she's sleeping with her mouth a little open
vict,o would i had the old magician's glass,to see her as she lies in childlike sleep
hark,how the loud and ponderous mace of time,knocks at the golden portals of the day
and so once more good night,we'll speak more largely,of preciosa when we meet again
must read or sit in revery and watch,the changing color of the waves that break,upon the idle sea-shore of the mind
visions of fame,that once did visit me,making night glorious with your smile where are ye
o who shall give me now that ye are gone,juices of those immortal plants that bloom,upon olympus making us immortal
prec,why will you go so soon,stay yet awhile
prec,the count of lara,o beware that man
ang,alas,what can i do
i cannot choose my friends,each word of kindness,come whence it may is welcome to the poor
no one can harm you,i am a poor girl,whom chance has taken from the public streets
amid a thousand perils i have worn it,here on my heart,it is my guardian angel
prec,no thanks,to-morrow come to me again
prec,i deserve no thanks,thank heaven not me
prec,may they guard thee too,and all the poor for they have need of angels
prec,o god,my evil genius
cruz,curses upon thee,thou art not my child
prec,beltran cruzado,hear me once for all
cruz,ay with all speed,i hate the crowded town
as panem et circenses was the cry,among the roman populace of old,so pan y toros is the cry in spain
hence i would act advisedly herein,and therefore have induced your grace to see,these national dances ere we interdict them
serv,the dancing-girl and with her the musicians,your grace was pleased to order wait without
card,o what a fair and ministering angel,was lost to heaven when this sweet woman fell
if i intrude upon your better hours,i proffer this excuse and here beseech,your holy benediction
card,dost thou remember,thy earlier days
arch,t is the alhambra,under whose towers the gypsy camp was pitched
hyp,some half-dozen ounces,which with due interest
don c,what am i a jew,to put my moneys out at usury
hyp,thank you,a pretty purse
don c,but tell me,come you to-day from alcala
a damsel has ensnared him with the glances,of her dark roving eyes as herdsmen catch,a steer of andalusia with a lazo
don c,and is it faring ill,to be in love
the roman emperor claudius had a wife,whose name was messalina as i think,valeria messalina was her name
but hist,i see him yonder through the trees,walking as in a dream
hyp,it has been truly said by some wise man,that money grief and love cannot be hidden
see how he strides away with lordly air,like that odd guest of stone that grim commander,who comes to sup with juan in the play
vict,how is that young and green-eyed gaditana,that you both wot of
a pretty girl and in her tender eyes,just that soft shade of green we sometimes see,in evening skies
hyp,but speaking of green eyes,are thine green
hyp,he does not think so and don carlos tells me,he boasts of his success
don,c,some hints of it i heard from his own lips
i'll cut his lying tongue out of his mouth,and throw it to my dog,but no no no
prec,begone,begone
lara,i thought it but a friendly part to tell you,what strange reports are current here in town
for my own self i do not credit them,but there are many who not knowing you,will lend a readier ear
lara,malicious tongues,are ever busy with your name
i've no protectors,i am a poor girl,exposed to insults and unfeeling jests
i give no cause for these reports,i live,retired am visited by none
lara,nay nay i will not wound your gentle soul,by the report of idle tales
lay not your hand upon me,one step nearer,and i will strike
prec,ay in truth,far better than you love yourself or me
lara,i swear to you,i would not harm you i would only love you
lara,first what right have you,to question thus a nobleman of spain
vict,ay here and elsewhere when the wrong of others,gives me the right
prec,too well thou knowest the presence of that man,is hateful to me
vict,yet i saw thee stand,and listen to him when he told his love
vict,indeed thou didst,and answeredst them with love
vict,i gave up all for thee myself my fame,my hopes of fortune ay my very soul
laugh at my folly with thy paramour,and sitting on the count of lara's knee,say what a poor fond fool victorian was
lara,there's nothing in this world so sweet as love,and next to love the sweetest thing is hate
fran,good my lord,he will be present
vict,and yet hypolito we may be wrong,we may be over-hasty in condemning
hyp,nay he is no coward,a villain if thou wilt but not a coward
and therefore be not over-confident,he'll task thy skill anon,look here he comes
vict,no,none
vict,you are disarmed,i will not kill you
put up your swords for to speak frankly to you,your cause of quarrel is too slight a thing,to move you to extremes
let me know all,all,all
lara,if further proof,is needful i have here a ring she gave me
bart,no matter,show me the house
lara,her pride is humbled and this very night,i mean to visit her
don l,yes try don dinero,a mighty wooer is your don dinero
good night,good night beloved,while i count the weary hours
ah,thou moon that shinest,argent-clear above
puss,puss,puss
bart,follow that,follow that
come with me,puss,puss
all silent in the street,and in the garden,hark
prec,i must go hence,i pray you do not harm me
shame,shame,to treat a feeble woman thus
i cannot stay,hark,how they mock at me
they hiss at me like serpents,save me,save me
hyp,thinking to walk in those arcadian pastures,thou hast run thy noble head against the wall
there rises from below a hand that grasp it,and waves it in the air and wailing voices,are heard along the shore
padre cura,good day,and pray you hear this edict read
pancho,and if in seventy days you are not gone,dead or alive i make you all my slaves
padre c,a righteous law,a very righteous law
they never marry never go to mass,never baptize their children nor keep lent,nor see the inside of a church nor nor
hyp,as we approached i said to my companion,that is the padre cura mark my words
hyp,your grace is right,you are the better scholar
padre c,from the marquis,not from the poet
your name is ever green in alcala,and our professor when we are unruly,will shake his hoary head and say alas
i've turned my back on what was then before me,and the bright faces of my young companions,are wrinkled like my own or are no more
padre c,fool that i am,he was before your time
padre c,well well,but i forget you must be hungry
padre c,this gentleman is hungry,see thou to it
pray you,senor excuse me,[exit
hyp,yes yes i know they did,give me your hand
hyp,what news is this that makes thy cheek turn pale,and thy hand tremble
vict,dear hypolito,how have i wronged that meek confiding heart
hyp,and have they with them a pale beautiful girl,called preciosa
hyp,yes moved with hunger,he is half famished with this long day's journey
padre c,then pray you come this way,the supper waits
prec,speak of that no more,i cannot
not mine,i never gave my heart to thee,nor promised thee my hand
that voice,that voice from heaven,o speak again
prec,t is he,t is he
prec,not in the dark,come nearer to the fire
vict,there is the,cross
prec,there's a fair lady at the court who loves you,and for yourself alone
shame,shame,o you have wronged the maid who loved you
vict,i never loved a maid,for she i loved was then a maid no more
vict,a little bird in the air,whispered the secret
vict,how like an angel's speaks the tongue of woman,when pleading in another's cause her own
prec,no never from my hand,shall that be taken
prec,no never,never
vict,be still my swelling heart,one moment still
vict,forgive me sweet,for what i made thee suffer
think'st thou this heart could feel a moment's joy,thou being absent,o believe it not
vict,i have heard all,and yet speak on speak on
let me but hear thy voice and i am happy,for every tone like some sweet incantation,calls up the buried past to plead for me
prec,senor hypolito,i kiss your hand
chispa,ay robbed and murdered and good evening to you,my worthy masters
prec,i have still,a hand to give
vict,no let it be a day of general joy,fortune comes well to all that comes not late
(song dies away,enter preciosa on horseback attended by,victorian hypolito don carlos and chispa on foot and armed
vict,this is the highest point,here let us rest
see preciosa see how all about us,kneeling like hooded friars the misty mountains,receive the benediction of the sun
bart,they passed this way,i hear their horses' hoofs
yonder i see them,come sweet caramillo,this serenade shall be the gypsy's last
ha,ha,well whistled my sweet caramillo
well whistled,i have missed her,o my god
in the market-place of bruges stands the belfry old and brown,thrice consumed and thrice rebuilded still it watches o'er the,town
at my feet the city slumbered,from its chimneys here and there,wreaths of snow-white smoke ascending vanished ghost-like into air
then the sound of drums aroused me,the awakened city's roar,chased the phantoms i had summoned back into their graves once more
hours had passed away like minutes and before i was aware,lo,the shadow of the belfry crossed the sun-illumined square
and every nation that should lift again,its hand against a brother on its forehead,would wear forevermore the curse of cain
peace,and no longer from its brazen portals,the blast of war's great organ shakes the skies
he counts it as no sin,that he sees therein,only his own thrift and gain
once ah once within these walls,one whom memory oft recalls,the father of his country dwelt
and yonder meadows broad and damp,the fires of the besieging camp,encircled with a burning belt
beneath us like an oriole's pendent nest,from which the laughing birds have taken wing,by thee abandoned hangs thy vacant swing
like the astrologers of eld,in that bright vision i beheld,greater and deeper mysteries
sirius was rising in the east,and slow ascending one by one,the kindling constellations shone
begirt with many a blazing star,stood the great giant algebar,orion hunter of the beast
thus moving on with silent pace,and triumph in her sweet pale face,she reached the station of orion
and suddenly from his outstretched arm,down fell the red skin of the lion,into the river at his feet
wrapt in thy scarlet blanket i see thee stalk through the city's,narrow and populous streets as once by the margin of rivers,stalked those birds unknown that have left us only their footprints
is it the cry of the foxes and crows or the mighty behemoth,who unharmed on his tusks once caught the bolts of the thunder,and now lurks in his lair to destroy the race of the red man
ha,how the breath of these saxons and celts like the blast of the east-wind,drifts evermore to the west the scanty smokes of thy wigwams
thou hast been their friend,they alas,have left thee friendless
from the pitcher placed between us,how the waters laugh and glisten,in the head of old silenus
even as a miser counts his gold,those hours the ancient timepiece told,forever never
all are scattered now and fled,some are married some are dead,and when i ask with throbs of pain
as in the days long since gone by,the ancient timepiece makes reply,forever never
the horologe of eternity,sayeth this incessantly,forever never
scattered like dust and leaves when the mighty blasts of october,seize them and whirl them aloft and sprinkle them far o'er the ocean,naught but tradition remains of the beautiful village of grand-pre
dikes that the hands of the farmers had raised with labor incessant,shut out the turbulent tides but at stated seasons the flood-gates,opened and welcomed the sea to wander at will o'er the meadows
neither locks had they to their doors nor bars to their windows,but their dwellings were open as day and the hearts of their owners,there the richest was poor and the poorest lived in abundance
stalworth and stately in form was the man of seventy winters,hearty and hale was he an oak that is covered with snow-flakes,white as the snow were his locks and his cheeks as brown as the oak-leaves
but a celestial brightness a more ethereal beauty,shone on her face and encircled her form when after confession,homeward serenely she walked with god's benediction upon her
firmly builded with rafters of oak the house of the farmer,stood on the side of a hill commanding the sea and a shady,sycamore grew by the door with a woodbine wreathing around it
under the sycamore-tree were hives overhung by a penthouse,such as the traveller sees in regions remote by the roadside,built o'er a box for the poor or the blessed image of mary
there too the dove-cot stood with its meek and innocent inmates,murmuring ever of love while above in the variant breezes,numberless noisy weathercocks rattled and sang of mutation
many a youth as he knelt in the church and opened his missal,fixed his eyes upon her as the saint of his deepest devotion,happy was he who might touch her hand or the hem of her garment
bees with prophetic instinct of want had hoarded their honey,till the hives overflowed and the indian bunters asserted,cold would the winter be for thick was the fur of the foxes
such was the advent of autumn,then followed that beautiful season,called by the pious acadian peasants the summer of all-saints
peace seemed to reign upon earth and the restless heart of the ocean,was for a moment consoled,all sounds were in harmony blended
foremost bearing the bell evangeline's beautiful heifer,proud of her snow-white hide and the ribbon that waved from her collar,quietly paced and slow as if conscious of human affection
patiently stood the cows meanwhile and yielded their udders,unto the milkmaid's hand whilst loud and in regular cadence,into the sounding pails the foaming streamlets descended
faces clumsily carved in oak on the back of his arm-chair,laughed in the flickering light and the pewter plates on the dresser,caught and reflected the flame as shields of armies the sunshine
fragments of song the old man sang and carols of christmas,such as at home in the olden time his fathers before him,sang in their norman orchards and bright burgundian vineyards
silent awhile were its treadles at rest was its diligent shuttle,while the monotonous drone of the wheel like the drone of a bagpipe,followed the old man's songs and united the fragments together
as in a church when the chant of the choir at intervals ceases,footfalls are heard in the aisles or words of the priest at the altar,so in each pause of the song with measured motion the clock clicked
then with a smile of content thus answered basil the blacksmith,taking with easy air the accustomed seat by the fireside,benedict bellefontaine thou hast ever thy jest and thy ballad
not so thinketh the folk in the village said warmly the blacksmith,shaking his head as in doubt then heaving a sigh he continued,louisburg is not forgotten nor beau sejour nor port royal
as apart by the window she stood with her hand in her lover's,blushing evangeline heard the words that her father had spoken,and as they died on his lips the worthy notary entered
then with modest demeanor made answer the notary public,gossip enough have i heard in sooth yet am never the wiser,and what their errand may be i know not better than others
god's name,shouted the hasty and somewhat irascible blacksmith,must we in all things look for the how and the why and the wherefore
wiping the foam from his lip he solemnly bowed and departed,while in silence the others sat and mused by the fireside,till evangeline brought the draught-board out of its corner
simple that chamber was with its curtains of white and its clothes-press,ample and high on whose spacious shelves were carefully folded,linen and woollen stuffs by the hand of evangeline woven
soon she extinguished her lamp for the mellow and radiant moonlight,streamed through the windows and lighted the room till the heart of the maiden,swelled and obeyed its power like the tremulous tides of the ocean
ah,she was fair exceeding fair to behold as she stood with,naked snow-white feet on the gleaming floor of her chamber
yet were her thoughts of him and at times a feeling of sadness,passed o'er her soul as the sailing shade of clouds in the moonlight,flitted across the floor and darkened the room for a moment
and as she gazed from the window she saw serenely the moon pass,forth from the folds of a cloud and one star follow her footsteps,as out of abraham's tent young ishmael wandered with hagar
every house was an inn where all were welcomed and feasted,for with this simple people who lived like brothers together,all things were held in common and what one had was another's
shadow and light from the leaves alternately played on his snow-white,hair as it waved in the wind and the jolly face of the fiddler,glowed like a living coal when the ashes are blown from the embers
gayly the old man sang to the vibrant sound of his fiddle,tous les bourgeois de chartres and le carillon de dunkerque,and anon with his wooden shoes beat time to the music
merrily merrily whirled the wheels of the dizzying dances,under the orchard-trees and down the path to the meadows,old folk and young together and children mingled among them
silent a moment they stood in speechless wonder and then rose,louder and ever louder a wail of sorrow and anger,and by one impulse moved they madly rushed to the door-way
flushed was his face and distorted with passion and wildly he shouted,down with the tyrants of england,we never have sworn them allegiance
then the old men as they marched and the women that stood by the wayside,joined in the sacred psalm and the birds in the sunshine above them,mingled their notes therewith like voices of spirits departed
busily plied the freighted boats and in the confusion,wives were torn from their husbands and mothers too late saw their children,left on the land extending their arms with wildest entreaties
back to its nethermost caves retreated the bellowing ocean,dragging adown the beach the rattling pebbles and leaving,inland and far up the shore the stranded boats of the sailors
onward from fire to fire as from hearth to hearth in his parish,wandered the faithful priest consoling and blessing and cheering,like unto shipwrecked paul on melita's desolate sea-shore
vainly evangeline strove with words and caresses to cheer him,vainly offered him food yet he moved not he looked not he spake not,but with a vacant stare ever gazed at the flickering fire-light
more he fain would have said but his heart was full and his accents,faltered and paused on his lips as the feet of a child on a threshold,hushed by the scene he beholds and the awful presence of sorrow
silently therefore he laid his hand on the head of the maiden,raising his tearful eyes to the silent stars that above them,moved on their way unperturbed by the wrongs and sorrows of mortals
then as the wind seized the gleeds and the burning thatch and uplifting,whirled them aloft through the air at once from a hundred house-tops,started the sheeted smoke with flashes of flame intermingled
loud on a sudden the cocks began to crow in the farm-yards,thinking the day had dawned and anon the lowing of cattle,came on the evening breeze by the barking of dogs interrupted
still the blaze of the burning village illumined the landscape,reddened the sky overhead and gleamed on the faces around her,and like the day of doom it seemed to her wavering senses
then recommenced once more the stir and noise of embarking,and with the ebb of the tide the ships sailed out of the harbor,leaving behind them the dead on the shore and the village in ruins
many a weary year had passed since the burning of grand-pre,when on the falling tide the freighted vessels departed,bearing a nation with all its household gods into exile
far asunder on separate coasts the acadians landed,scattered were they like flakes of snow when the wind from the northeast,strikes aslant through the fogs that darken the banks of newfoundland
gabriel lajeunesse,they said yes,we have seen him
gabriel lajeunesse,said others o yes,we have seen him
are there not other youths as fair as gabriel,others,who have hearts as tender and true and spirits as loyal
thereupon the priest her friend and father-confessor,said with a smile o daughter,thy god thus speaketh within thee
onward o'er sunken sands through a wilderness sombre with forests,day after day they glided adown the turbulent river,night after night by their blazing fires encamped on its borders
level the landscape grew and along the shores of the river,shaded by china-trees in the midst of luxuriant gardens,stood the houses of planters with negro-cabins and dove-cots
they were approaching the region where reigns perpetual summer,where through the golden coast and groves of orange and citron,sweeps with majestic curve the river away to the eastward
they too swerved from their course and entering the bayou of plaquemine,soon were lost in a maze of sluggish and devious waters,which like a network of steel extended in every direction
over their heads the towering and tenebrous boughs of the cypress,met in a dusky arch and trailing mosses in mid-air,waved like banners that hang on the walls of ancient cathedrals
deathlike the silence seemed and unbroken save by the herons,home to their roasts in the cedar-trees returning at sunset,or by the owl as he greeted the moon with demoniac laughter
lovely the moonlight was as it glanced and gleamed on the water,gleamed on the columns of cypress and cedar sustaining the arches,down through whose broken vaults it fell as through chinks in a ruin
dreamlike and indistinct and strange were all things around them,and o'er their spirits there came a feeling of wonder and sadness,strange forebodings of ill unseen and that cannot be compassed
then in his place at the prow of the boat rose one of the oarsmen,and as a signal sound if others like them peradventure,sailed on those gloomy and midnight streams blew a blast on his bugle
water-lilies in myriads rocked on the slight undulations,made by the passing oars and resplendent in beauty the lotus,lifted her golden crown above the heads of the boatmen
under the boughs of wachita willows that grew by the margin,safely their boat was moored and scattered about on the greensward,tired with their midnight toil the weary travellers slumbered
nearer ever nearer among the numberless islands,darted a light swift boat that sped away o'er the water,urged on its course by the sinewy arms of hunters and trappers
after the sound of their oars on the tholes had died in the distance,as from a magic trance the sleepers awoke and the maiden,said with a sigh to the friendly priest o father felician
beautiful is the land with its prairies and forests of fruit-trees,under the feet a garden of flowers and the bluest of heavens,bending above and resting its dome on the walls of the forest
large and low was the roof and on slender columns supported,rose-wreathed vine-encircled a broad and spacious veranda,haunt of the humming-bird and the bee extended around it
at each end of the house amid the flowers of the garden,stationed the dove-cots were as love's perpetual symbol,scenes of endless wooing and endless contentions of rivals
in the rear of the house from the garden gate ran a pathway,through the great groves of oak to the skirts of the limitless prairie,into whose sea of flowers the sun was slowly descending
full in his track of light like ships with shadowy canvas,hanging loose from their spars in a motionless calm in the tropics,stood a cluster of trees with tangled cordage of grapevines
thus they ascended the steps and crossing the breezy veranda,entered the hall of the house where already the supper of basil,waited his late return and they rested and feasted together
all was silent without and illuming the landscape with silver,fair rose the dewy moon and the myriad stars but within doors,brighter than these shone the faces of friends in the glimmering lamplight
here too numberless herds run wild and unclaimed in the prairies,here too lands may be had for the asking and forests of timber,with a few blows of the axe are hewn and framed into houses
after your houses are built and your fields are yellow with harvests,no king george of england shall drive you away from your homesteads,burning your dwellings and barns and stealing your farms and your cattle
nearer and round about her the manifold flowers of the garden,poured out their souls in odors that were their prayers and confessions,unto the night as it went its way like a silent carthusian
and the soul of the maiden between the stars and the fire-flies,wandered alone and she cried o gabriel,o my beloved
ah,how often beneath this oak returning from labor,thou hast lain down to rest and to dream of me in thy slumbers
loud and sudden and near the note of a whippoorwill sounded,like a flute in the woods and anon through the neighboring thickets,farther and farther away it floated and dropped into silence
patience,whispered the oaks from oracular caverns of darkness,and from the moonlit meadow a sigh responded to-morrow
bright rose the sun next day and all the flowers of the garden,bathed his shining feet with their tears and anointed his tresses,with the delicious balm that they bore in their vases of crystal
farewell,answered the maiden and smiling with basil descended,down to the river's brink where the boatmen already were waiting
thus beginning their journey with morning and sunshine and gladness,swiftly they followed the flight of him who was speeding before them,blown by the blast of fate like a dead leaf over the desert
down from their jagged deep ravines where the gorge like a gateway,opens a passage rude to the wheels of the emigrant's wagon,westward the oregon flows and the walleway and owyhee
spreading between these streams are the wondrous beautiful prairies,billowy bays of grass ever rolling in shadow and sunshine,bright with luxuriant clusters of roses and purple amorphas
sometimes they saw or thought they saw the smoke of his camp-fire,rise in the morning air from the distant plain but at nightfall,when they had reached the place they found only embers and ashes
and though their hearts were sad at times and their bodies were weary,hope still guided them on as the magic fata morgana,showed them her lakes of light that retreated and vanished before them
once as they sat by their evening fire there silently entered,into the little camp an indian woman whose features,wore deep traces of sorrow and patience as great as her sorrow
she was a shawnee woman returning home to her people,from the far-off hunting-grounds of the cruel camanches,where her canadian husband a coureur-des-bois had been murdered
touched were their hearts at her story and warmest and friendliest welcome,gave they with words of cheer and she sat and feasted among them,on the buffalo-meat and the venison cooked on the embers
moved to the depths of her soul by pity and woman's compassion,yet in her sorrow pleased that one who had suffered was near her,she in turn related her love and all its disasters
silent with wonder and strange surprise evangeline listened,to the soft flow of her magical words till the region around her,seemed like enchanted ground and her swarthy guest the enchantress
slowly over the tops of the ozark mountains the moon rose,lighting the little tent and with a mysterious splendor,touching the sombre leaves and embracing and filling the woodland
filled with the thoughts of love was evangeline's heart but a secret,subtile sense crept in of pain and indefinite terror,as the cold poisonous snake creeps into the nest of the swallow
early upon the morrow the march was resumed and the shawnee,said as they journeyed along on the western slope of these mountains,dwells in his little village the black robe chief of the mission
soft was the voice of the priest and he spake with an accent of kindness,but on evangeline's heart fell his words as in winter the snow-flakes,fall into some lone nest from which the birds have departed
then in the golden weather the maize was husked and the maidens,blushed at each blood-red ear for that betokened a lover,but at the crooked laughed and called it a thief in the corn-field
so came the autumn and passed and the winter yet gabriel came not,blossomed the opening spring and the notes of the robin and bluebird,sounded sweet upon wold and in wood yet gabriel came not
when over weary ways by long and perilous marches,she had attained at length the depths of the michigan forests,found she the hunter's lodge deserted and fallen to ruin
then there appeared and spread faint streaks of gray o'er her forehead,dawn of another life that broke o'er her earthy horizon,as in the eastern sky the first faint streaks of the morning
in that delightful land which is washed by the delaware's waters,guarding in sylvan shades the name of penn the apostle,stands on the banks of its beautiful stream the city he founded
there all the air is balm and the peach is the emblem of beauty,and the streets still re-echo the names of the trees of the forest,as if they fain would appease the dryads whose haunts they molested
so when the fruitless search the disappointed endeavor,ended to recommence no more upon earth uncomplaining,thither as leaves to the light were turned her thoughts and her footsteps
night after night when the world was asleep as the watchman repeated,loud through the gusty streets that all was well in the city,high at some lonely window he saw the light of her taper
day after day in the gray of the dawn as slow through the suburbs,plodded the german farmer with flowers and fruits for the market,met he that meek pale face returning home from its watchings
then it came to pass that a pestilence fell on the city,presaged by wondrous signs and mostly by flocks of wild pigeons,darkening the sun in their flight with naught in their craws but an acorn
hot and red on his lips still burned the flush of the fever,as if life like the hebrew with blood had besprinkled its portals,that the angel of death might see the sign and pass over
motionless senseless dying he lay and his spirit exhausted,seemed to be sinking down through infinite depths in the darkness,darkness of slumber and death forever sinking and sinking
all was ended now the hope and the fear and the sorrow,all the aching of heart the restless unsatisfied longing,all the dull deep pain and constant anguish of patience
only along the shore of the mournful and misty atlantic,linger a few acadian peasants whose fathers from exile,wandered back to their native land to die in its bosom
i hear your voices softened by the distance,and pause and turn to listen as each sends,his words of friendship comfort and assistance
thanks for each kindly word each silent token,that teaches me when seeming most alone,friends are around us though no word be spoken
your gentle voices will flow on forever,when life grows bare and tarnished with decay,as through a leafless landscape flows a river
stanch and strong a goodly vessel,that shall laugh at all disaster,and with wave and whirlwind wrestle
that silent architect the sun,had hewn and laid them every one,ere the work of man was yet begun
beside the master when he spoke,a youth against an anchor leaning,listened to catch his slightest meaning
only the long waves as they broke,in ripples on the pebbly beach,interrupted the old man's speech
the sun shone on her golden hair,and her cheek was glowing fresh and fair,with the breath of morn and the soft sea air
and when the hot long day was o'er,the young man at the master's door,sat with the maiden calm and still
therefore he spake and thus said he,like unto ships far off at sea,outward or homeward bound are we
ah,what pleasant visions haunt me,as i gaze upon the sea
and with your floating bridge the ocean span,be mine to guard this light from all eclipse,be yours to bring man nearer unto man
they were indeed too much akin,the drift-wood fire without that burned,the thoughts that burned and glowed within
now in this crystal tower,imprisoned by some curious hand at last,it counts the passing hour
but not for this their revels,the jovial monks forbore,for they cried fill high the goblet
take this lesson to thy heart,that is best which lieth nearest,shape from that thy work of art
i heard a voice that cried,balder the beautiful,is dead is dead
and through the misty air,passed like the mournful cry,of sunward sailing cranes
i saw the pallid corpse,of the dead sun,borne through the northern sky
blasts from niffelheim,lifted the sheeted mists,around him as he passed
and the voice forever cried,balder the beautiful,is dead is dead
and died away,through the dreary night,in accents of despair
balder the beautiful,god of the summer sun,fairest of all the gods
light from his forehead beamed,runes were upon his tongue,as on the warrior's sword
they laid him in his ship,with horse and harness,as on a funeral pyre
odin placed,a ring upon his finger,and whispered in his ear
but out of the sea of time,rises a new land of song,fairer than the old
build it again,o ye bards,fairer than before
ye fathers of the new race,feed upon morning dew,sing the new song of love
sing no more,o ye bards of the north,of vikings and of jarls
of the days of eld,preserve the freedom only,not the deeds of blood
leaving us heirs to amplest heritages,of all the best thoughts of the greatest sages,and giving tongues unto the silent dead
take them o death,and bear away,whatever thou canst call thine own
our little life is but a gust,that bends the branches of thy tree,and trails its blossoms in the dust
like the beloved john,to lay his head upon the saviour's breast,and thus to journey on
tell us of this nawadaha,i should answer your inquiries,straightway in such words as follow
gitche manito the mighty,the great spirit the creator,smiled upon his helpless children
thus was slain the mishe-mokwa,he the great bear of the mountains,he the terror of the nations
no more work and no more weeping,wahonowin,wahonowin
lulled him into slumber singing,ewa-yea,my little owlet
saw the rainbow in the heaven,in the eastern sky the rainbow,whispered what is that nokomis
sang the robin the opechee,sang the bluebird the owaissa,do not shoot us hiawatha
all the village came and feasted,all the guests praised hiawatha,called him strong-heart soan-ge-taha
welcome,said he hiawatha,to the kingdom of the west-wind
ah kaween,said mudjekeewis,no indeed i will not touch it
hold,at length cried mudjekeewis,hold my son my hiawatha
i have put you to this trial,but to know and prove your courage,now receive the prize of valor
then he smiled and said: to-morrow,is the last day of your conflict,is the last day of your fasting
lazy kwasind,said his mother,in my work you never help me
in the coldest days of winter,i must break the ice for fishing,with my nets you never help me
at the door my nets are hanging,dripping freezing with the water,go and wring them yenadizze
of your strong and pliant branches,my canoe to make more steady,make more strong and firm beneath me
i will make a necklace of them,make a girdle for my beauty,and two stars to deck her bosom
take my bait cried hiawatha,down into the depths beneath him,take my bait o sturgeon nahma
you are ugudwash the sun-fish,you are not the fish i wanted,you are not the king of fishes
then began the greatest battle,that the sun had ever looked on,that the war-birds ever witnessed
still dissuading said nokomis,bring not to my lodge a stranger,from the land of the dacotahs
thus it was he won the daughter,of the ancient arrow-maker,in the land of the dacotahs
sang the robin the opechee,happy are you laughing water,having such a noble husband
barred with streaks of red and yellow,streaks of blue and bright vermilion,shone the face of pau-puk-keewis
over it the star of evening,melts and trembles through the purple,hangs suspended in the twilight
you shall hear a tale of wonder,hear the story of osseo,son of the evening star osseo
and her lovers the rejected,handsome men with belts of wampum,handsome men with paint and feathers
changed into a weak old woman,with a staff she tottered onward,wasted wrinkled old and ugly
and behold,the earthen kettles,all were changed to bowls of silver
t was no bird he saw before him,t was a beautiful young woman,with the arrow in her bosom
in those days said hiawatha,lo,how all things fade and perish
very crafty very cunning,is the creeping spirit of evil,was the meaning of this symbol
then the figure seated singing,playing on a drum of magic,and the interpretation listen
when i speak the wigwam trembles,shakes the sacred lodge with terror,hands unseen begin to shake it
ay,why do the living said they,lay such heavy burdens on us
i will slay this pau-puk-keewis,slay this mischief-maker,said he
make me large said pau-puk-keewis,make me large and make me larger,larger than the other beavers
here they made him large and larger,made him largest of the beavers,ten times larger than the others
death to kwasind,was the sudden,war-cry of the little people
then he turned and saw the strangers,cowering crouching with the shadows,said within himself who are they
but he questioned not the strangers,only spake to bid them welcome,to his lodge his food his fireside
from the realms of chibiabos,hither have we come to try you,hither have we come to warn you
we are but a burden to you,and we see that the departed,have no place among the living
cried he with his face uplifted,in that bitter hour of anguish,give your children food o father
no my child,said old nokomis,t is the night-wind in the pine-trees
in his lodge beside a river,close beside a frozen river,sat an old man sad and lonely
ah my son,exclaimed the old man,happy are my eyes to see you
at each other looked the warriors,looked the women at each other,smiled and said it cannot be so
from its mouth he said to greet him,came waywassimo the lightning,came the thunder annemeekee
gitche manito the mighty,the great spirit the creator,sends them hither on his errand
i beheld too in that vision,all the secrets of the future,of the distant days that shall be
or the white goose waw-be-wawa,with the water dripping flashing,from its glossy neck and feathers
i am going o nokomis,on a long and distant journey,to the portals of the sunset
and the forests dark and lonely,moved through all their depths of darkness,sighed farewell o hiawatha
and the waves upon the margin,rising rippling on the pebbles,sobbed farewell o hiawatha
thus departed hiawatha,hiawatha the beloved,in the glory of the sunset
the scene of the poem is among the ojibways on the southern shore of,lake superior in the region between the pictured rocks and the,grand sable
thereupon answered john alden but looked not up from his writing,truly the breath of the lord hath slackened the speed of the bullet,he in his mercy preserved you to be our shield and our weapon
still the captain continued unheeding the words of the stripling,see how bright they are burnished as if in an arsenal hanging,that is because i have done it myself and not left it to others
green above her is growing the field of wheat we have sown there,better to hide from the indian scouts the graves of our people,lest they should count them and see how many already have perished
nothing was heard in the room but the hurrying pen of the stripling,busily writing epistles important to go by the mayflower,ready to sail on the morrow or next day at latest god willing
homeward bound with the tidings of all that terrible winter,letters written by alden and full of the name of priscilla,full of the name and the fame of the puritan maiden priscilla
go to the damsel priscilla the loveliest maiden of plymouth,say that a blunt old captain a man not of words but of actions,offers his hand and his heart the hand and heart of a soldier
you who are bred as a scholar can say it in elegant language,such as you read in your books of the pleadings and wooings of lovers,such as you think best adapted to win the heart of a maiden
to and fro in his breast his thoughts were heaving and dashing,as in a foundering ship with every roll of the vessel,washes the bitter sea the merciless surge of the ocean
truly the heart is deceitful and out of its depths of corruption,rise like an exhalation the misty phantoms of passion,angels of light they seem but are only delusions of satan
this is the hand of the lord it is laid upon me in anger,for i have followed too much the heart's desires and devices,worshipping astaroth blindly and impious idols of baal
had he but spoken then,perhaps not in vain had he spoken,now it was all too late the golden moment had vanished
yours is tender and trusting and needs a stronger to lean on,so i have come to you now with an offer and proffer of marriage,made by a good man and true miles standish the captain of plymouth
welcome o wind of the east,he exclaimed in his wild exultation,welcome o wind of the east from the caves of the misty atlantic
fierce in his soul was the struggle and tumult of passions contending,love triumphant and crowned and friendship wounded and bleeding,passionate cries of desire and importunate pleadings of duty
still for a moment he stood and listened and stared at the vessel,then went hurriedly on as one who seeing a phantom,stops then quickens his pace and follows the beckoning shadow
better to be in my grave in the green old churchyard in england,close by my mother's side and among the dust of my kindred,better be dead and forgotten than living in shame and dishonor
soon he entered his door and found the redoubtable captain,sitting alone and absorbed in the martial pages of caesar,fighting some great campaign in hainault or brabant or flanders
not far off is the house although the woods are between us,but you have lingered so long that while you were going and coming,i have fought ten battles and sacked and demolished a city
but in the midst of his anger a man appeared at the doorway,bringing in uttermost haste a message of urgent importance,rumors of danger and war and hostile incursions of indians
straightway the captain paused and without further question or parley,took from the nail on the wall his sword with its scabbard of iron,buckled the belt round his waist and frowning fiercely departed
alden was left alone,he heard the clank of the scabbard,growing fainter and fainter and dying away in the distance
god had sifted three kingdoms to find the wheat for this planting,then had sifted the wheat as the living seed of a nation,so say the chronicles old and such is the faith of the people
but unheeded fell this mild rebuke on the captain,who had advanced to the table and thus continued discoursing,leave this matter to me for to me by right it pertaineth
silently out of the room then glided the glistening savage,bearing the serpent's skin and seeming himself like a serpent,winding his sinuous way in the dark to the depths of the forest
just in the gray of the dawn as the mists uprose from the meadows,there was a stir and a sound in the slumbering village of plymouth,clanging and clicking of arms and the order imperative forward
standish the stalwart it was with eight of his valorous army,led by their indian guide by hobomok friend of the white men,northward marching to quell the sudden revolt of the savage
giants they seemed in the mist or the mighty men of king david,giants in heart they were who believed in god and the bible,ay who believed in the smiting of midianites and philistines
over them gleamed far off the crimson banners of morning,under them loud on the sands the serried billows advancing,fired along the line and in regular order retreated
foremost among them was alden,all night he had lain without slumber,turning and tossing about in the heat and unrest of his fever
he had beheld miles standish who came back late from the council,stalking into the room and heard him mutter and murmur,sometimes it seemed a prayer and sometimes it sounded like swearing
once he had come to the bed and stood there a moment in silence,then he had turned away and said: i will not awake him,let him sleep on it is best for what is the use of more talking
nearer the boat stood alden with one foot placed on the gunwale,one still firm on the rock and talking at times with the sailors,seated erect on the thwarts all ready and eager for starting
he too was eager to go and thus put an end to his anguish,thinking to fly from despair that swifter than keel is or canvas,thinking to drown in the sea the ghost that would rise and pursue him
mournfully sobbed the waves at the base of the rock and above them,bowed and whispered the wheat on the hill of death and their kindred,seemed to awake in their graves and to join in the prayer that they uttered
sun-illumined and white on the eastern verge of the ocean,gleamed the departing sail like a marble slab in a graveyard,buried beneath it lay for ever all hope of escaping
what i thought was a flower is only a weed and is worthless,out of my heart will i pluck it and throw it away and henceforward,be but a fighter of battles a lover and wooer of dangers
thus he revolved in his mind his sorry defeat and discomfort,while he was marching by day or lying at night in the forest,looking up at the trees and the constellations beyond them
braves of the tribe were these and brothers gigantic in stature,huge as goliath of gath or the terrible og king of bashan,one was pecksuot named and the other was called wattawamat
welcome english,they said these words they had learned from the traders,touching at times on the coast to barter and chaffer for peltries
but when he heard their defiance the boast the taunt and the insult,all the hot blood of his race of sir hugh and of thurston de standish,boiled and beat in his heart and swelled in the veins of his temples
headlong he leaped on the boaster and snatching his knife from its scabbard,plunged it into his heart and reeling backward the savage,fell with his face to the sky and a fiendlike fierceness upon it
bravely the stalwart miles standish was scouring the land with his forces,waxing valiant in fight and defeating the alien armies,till his name had become a sound of fear to the nations
wooden-barred was the door and the roof was covered with rushes,latticed the windows were and the window-panes were of paper,oiled to admit the light while wind and rain were excluded
hold this skein on your hands while i wind it ready for knitting,then who knows but hereafter when fashions have changed and the manners,fathers may talk to their sons of the good old times of john alden
lo,in the midst of this scene a breathless messenger entered,bringing in hurry and heat the terrible news from the village
friends were assembled together the elder and magistrate also,graced the scene with their presence and stood like the law and the gospel,one with the sanction of earth and one with the blessing of heaven
softly the youth and the maiden repeated the words of betrothal,taking each other for husband and wife in the magistrate's presence,after the puritan way and the laudable custom of holland
fervently then and devoutly the excellent elder of plymouth,prayed for the hearth and the home that were founded that day in affection,speaking of life and of death and imploring divine benedictions
lo,when the service was ended a form appeared on the threshold,clad in armor of steel a sombre and sorrowful figure
but when were ended the troth and the prayer and the last benediction,into the room it strode and the people beheld with amazement,bodily there in his armor miles standish the captain of plymouth
i have been angry and hurt too long have i cherished the feeling,i have been cruel and hard but now thank god,it is ended
then he said with a smile: i should have remembered the adage,if you would be well served you must serve yourself and moreover,no man can gather cherries in kent at the season of christmas
soon was their vision disturbed by the noise and stir of departure,friends coming forth from the house and impatient of longer delaying,each with his plan for the day and the work that was left uncompleted
somewhat alarmed at first but reassured by the others,placing her hand on the cushion her foot in the hand of her husband,gayly with joyous laugh priscilla mounted her palfrey
pleasantly murmured the brook as they crossed the ford in the forest,pleased with the image that passed like a dream of love through its bosom,tremulous floating in air o'er the depths of the azure abysses
those sounds that flow,in murmurs of delight and woe,come not from wings of birds
through the cloud-rack dark and trailing,must they see above them sailing,o'er life's barren crags the vulture
what,are these the guests whose glances,seemed like sunshine gleaming round me
these the wild bewildering fancies,that with dithyrambic dances,as with magic circles bound me
spectral gleam their snow-white dresses,and from loose dishevelled tresses,fall the hyacinthine blossoms
o my songs,whose winsome measures,filled my heart with secret rapture
for thou makest each mystery clearer,and the unattained seems nearer,when thou fillest my heart with fever
was she a lady of high degree,so much in love with the vanity,and foolish pomp of this world of ours
or was it christian charity,and lowliness and humility,the richest and rarest of all dowers
ah you will then have other cares,in your own short-comings and despairs,in your own secret sins and terrors
adding then by way of jest,golondrina is my guest,tis the wife of some deserter
the mourners said and death is rest and peace,then added in the certainty of faith,and giveth life that never more shall cease
the groaning earth in travail and in pain,brings forth its races but does not restore,and the dead nations never rise again
its vacant eyes,stare at the skies,stare at the valley green and deep
under the walls of monterey,at daybreak the bugles began to play,victor galbraith
he looked at the earth he looked at the sky,he looked at the files of musketry,victor galbraith
three balls are in his breast and brain,but he rises out of the dust again,victor galbraith
forth dart once more those tongues of flame,and the bugler has died a death of shame,victor galbraith
under the walls of monterey,by night a bugle is heard to play,victor galbraith
and the dead captains as they lay,in their graves o'erlooking the tranquil bay,where they in battle died
and hurried landward far away,crying awake,it is the day
it shouted through the belfry-tower,awake o bell,proclaim the hour
it crossed the churchyard with a sigh,and said not yet,in quiet lie
for his voice i listen and yearn,it is growing late and dark,and my boy does not return
for i hear you at your play,and the questions that perplexed me,have vanished quite away
ah,what would the world be to us,if the children were no more
and whisper in my ear,what the birds and the winds are singing,in your sunny atmosphere
ah me,for the land that is sown,with the harvest of despair
where the burning cinders blown,from the lips of the overthrown,enceladus fill the air
and the storm-wind shouts through the pines,of alps and of apennines,enceladus arise
strike your flag,the rebel cries,in his arrogant old plantation strain
never,our gallant morris replies,it is better to sink than to yield
every waft of the air,was a whisper of prayer,or a dirge for the dead
blow winds,and waft through all the rooms,the snow-flakes of the cherry-blooms
blow winds,and bend within my reach,the fiery blossoms of the peach
o life and love,o happy throng,of thoughts whose only speech is song
o heart of man,canst thou not be,blithe as the air is and as free
a region of repose it seems,a place of slumber and of dreams,remote among the wooded hills
last the musician as he stood,illumined by that fire of wood,fair-haired blue-eyed his aspect blithe
meanwhile impatient to mount and ride,booted and spurred with a heavy stride,on the opposite shore walked paul revere
and lo,as he looks on the belfry's height,a glimmer and then a gleam of light
he springs to the saddle the bridle he turns,but lingers and gazes till full on his sight,a second lamp in the belfry burns
thus ariosto says in words,that have the stately stride and ring,of armed knights and clashing swords
beautiful falcon,said he would that i,might hold thee on my wrist or see thee fly
who is thy mother my fair boy,he said,his hand laid softly on that shining head
monna giovanna,will you let me stay,a little while and with your falcon play
rabbi ben levi on the sabbath read,a volume of the law in which it said,no man shall look upon my face and live
and as he read he prayed that god would give,his faithful servant grace with mortal eye,to look upon his face and yet not die
beyond the outer wall the angel of death,heard the great voice and said with panting breath,give back the sword and let me go my way
i am the god thor,i am the war god,i am the thunderer
here in my northland,my fastness and fortress,reign i forever
when at sea with all his rowers,he along the bending oars,outside of his ship could run
he the smalsor horn ascended,and his shining shield suspended,on its summit like a sun
thora of rimol,hide me,hide me
hakon jarl,for the love i bear thee,neither shall shame nor death come near thee
then why dost thou turn so pale o churl,and then again black as the earth,said the earl
and they answered: o queen,if the truth must be told,the ring is of copper and not of gold
why then should i care to have thee,he said,a faded old woman a heathenish jade
half my kingdom would i give,as i live,if by such songs you would earn it
hearken to me then o king,while i sing,the great ocean song that haunts me
then athwart the vapors dun,the easter sun,streamed with one broad track of splendor
in their real forms appeared,the warlocks weird,awful as the witch of endor
sing o scald your song sublime,your ocean-rhyme,cried king olaf: it will cheer me
said the scald with pallid cheeks,the skerry of shrieks,sings too loud for you to hear me
olaf the king one summer morn,blew a blast on his bugle-horn,sending his signal through the land of drontheim
and to the hus-ting held at mere,gathered the farmers far and near,with their war weapons ready to confront him
ploughing under the morning star,old iron-beard in yriar,heard the summons chuckling with a low laugh
he wiped the sweat-drops from his brow,unharnessed his horses from the plough,and clattering came on horseback to king olaf
he was the churliest of the churls,little he cared for king or earls,bitter as home-brewed ale were his foaming passions
hodden-gray was the garb he wore,and by the hammer of thor he swore,he hated the narrow town and all its fashions
but he loved the freedom of his farm,his ale at night by the fireside warm,gudrun his daughter with her flaxen tresses
he loved his horses and his herds,the smell of the earth and the song of birds,his well-filled barns his brook with its water-cresses
huge and cumbersome was his frame,his beard from which he took his name,frosty and fierce like that of hymer the giant
so at the hus-ting he appeared,the farmer of yriar iron-beard,on horseback in an attitude defiant
and to king olaf he cried aloud,out of the middle of the crowd,that tossed about him like a stormy ocean
such sacrifices shalt thou bring,to odin and to thor o king,as other kings have done in their devotion
king olaf answered: i command,this land to be a christian land,here is my bishop who the folk baptizes
but if you ask me to restore,your sacrifices stained with gore,then will i offer human sacrifices
not slaves and peasants shall they be,but men of note and high degree,such men as orm of lyra and kar of gryting
then to their temple strode he in,and loud behind him heard the din,of his men-at-arms and the peasants fiercely fighting
there in the temple carved in wood,the image of great odin stood,and other gods with thor supreme among them
king olaf smote them with the blade,of his huge war-axe gold inlaid,and downward shattered to the pavement flung them
at the same moment rose without,from the contending crowd a shout,a mingled sound of triumph and of wailing
and there upon the trampled plain,the farmer iron-beard lay slain,midway between the assailed and the assailing
and seeing their leader stark and dead,the people with a murmur said,o king baptize us with thy holy water
so all the drontheim land became,a christian land in name and fame,in the old gods no more believing and trusting
and as a blood-atonement soon,king olaf wed the fair gudrun,and thus in peace ended the drontheim hus-ting
cold will be the dagger's kiss,laden with the chill of death,is its breath
forests have ears and fields have eyes,often treachery lurking lies,underneath the fairest hair
every scald,satires scrawled,on poor thangbrand olaf's priest
o king olaf,little hope,is there of these iceland men
meekly said,with bending head,pious thangbrand olaf's priest
little time have we for speaking,choose between the good and evil,be baptized or thou shalt die
sing me a song divine,with a sword in every line,and this shall be thy reward
and he loosened the belt at his waist,and in front of the singer placed,his sword
but the king said o my son,i miss the bright word in one,of thy measures and thy rhymes
and halfred the scald replied,in another 't was multiplied,three times
and halfred the scald said this,in the name of the lord i kiss,who on it was crucified
and a shout went round the board,in the name of christ the lord,who died
could you not be gone a minute,but some mischief must be doing,turning bad to worse
they who to the saga listened,heard the name of thorberg skafting,for a hundred year
thirty men they each commanded,iron-sinewed horny-handed,shoulders broad and chests expanded
when they landed from the fleet,how they roared through drontheim's street,boisterous as the gale
never saw the wild north sea,such a gallant company,sail its billows blue
the king yes olaf the king,has wedded her with his ring,and thyri is queen in the land
i your pilot will be,for i know all the channels,where flows the deep sea
king olaf laid an arrow on string,have i a coward on board,said he
sullenly answered ulf,the old sea-wolf,you have need of me
what was that,said olaf standing,on the quarter-deck
it is accepted,the angry defiance,the challenge of battle
it is accepted,but not with the weapons,of war that thou wieldest
cross against corselet,love against hatred,peace-cry for war-cry
patience is powerful,he that o'ercometh,hath power o'er the nations
the dawn is not distant,nor is the night starless,love is eternal
god is still god and,his faith shall not fail us,christ is eternal
and all translated in the air,reach me but as our dear lord's prayer,and as the sermon on the mount
o pitiless skies,why did your clouds retain,for peasants' fields their floods of hoarded rain
o pitiless earth,why open no abyss,to bury in its chasm a crime like this
then from his house a temple painted white,with fluted columns and a roof of red,the squire came forth august and splendid sight
or a few cherries that are not so sweet,as are the songs these uninvited guests,sing at their feast with comfortable breasts
of empty nests that cling to boughs and beams,as in an idiot's brain remembered words,hang empty 'mid the cobwebs of his dreams
and so the dreadful massacre began,o'er fields and orchards and o'er woodland crests,the ceaseless fusillade of terror ran
alone remained the drowsy squire,to rake the embers of the fire,and quench the waning parlor light
this brings a tale into my mind,which if you are not disinclined,to listen i will now relate
domeneddio,cried the syndie straight,this is the knight of atri's steed of state
or dreaming speak to us and make,a feint of being half awake,and tell us what your dreams may be

they said that you foresaw our visit here,and blinded them so that they could not see,the clothes you wore
and the elders and the nobles in the city,did even as jezebel the wife of ahab,had sent to them and written in the letters
now we'll rest awhile,and take our nooning,what's the matter with you
do you see that,don't tell me it's not witchcraft,two of us could not lift that cask as he does
what is that,i surely,heard some one calling me by name
the dream,the dream,o god be merciful
if hard work and low wages make good masters,then he is one,but i think otherwise
that's witchcraft,why if they had teeth like yours,t would be no wonder if the girls were bitten
and then those ghosts that come out of their graves,and cry you murdered us,you murdered us
and there's old corey he has got a horseshoe,nailed on his doorstep to keep off the witches,and all the same his wife has gone to prison
oh she's no witch,i'll swear that goodwife corey,never did harm to any living creature
and now be quiet will you,i am tired,and want to sleep here on the grass a little
the hypocrite,she's always on her knees,but she prays to the devil when she prays
the meeting-house is full,i never saw,so great a crowd before
we shall find room enough by elbowing,our way among them,put your shoulder to it
we have not sent for you nor are we here,to hear you pray but to examine you,in whatsoever is alleged against you
i never had to do with any witchcraft,since i was born,i am a gospel woman
then answer me: when certain persons came,to see you yesterday how did you know,beforehand why they came
i had had speech,the children said i hurt them and i thought,these people came to question me about it
i must speak the truth,i did not tell her,it was some one else
she threatened me stabbed at me with her spindle,and when my brother thrust her with his sword,he tore her gown and cut a piece away
and there are persons here who know the truth,of what has now been said,what answer make you
did you not,on one occasion hide your husband's saddle,to hinder him from coming to the sessions
what then was the book,you showed to this young woman and besought her,to write in it
the next sabbath,is the communion day but martha corey,will not be there
what,is it not enough,would you hear more
is it not true that fourteen head of cattle,to you belonging broke from their enclosure,and leaped into the river and were drowned
then i will tell you,it is some one near you,you see her now this woman your own wife
go quick,they're waiting for you,you are late
the dream,the dream,the dream
i know my death is foreordained by you,mine and my wife's,therefore i will not answer
i've seen him lead the field,on a hot day in mowing and against,us younger men and i have wrestled with him
it might have been an easier death,your doom,will be on your own head and not on ours
giles corey and martha corey are in prison,down there in salem village,both are witches
and now i find him shipwrecked utterly,drifting upon this sea of sorceries,and lost perhaps beyond all aid of man
and disappoint my foes,they are but thine avenging sword,whose wounds are swift to close
hark hark,it is her voice,she is not dead
corey hides his face in his hands,enter the jailer followed by,richard gardner
of all the friends i had in happier days,you are the first ay and the only one,that comes to seek me out in my disgrace
i thank you,there is something in your presence,i know not what it is that gives me strength
giles corey,come,the hour has struck
the life of man is a gleam,of light that comes and goes,like the course of the holy stream
but alas,alas for me,not yet this rest shall be
he toucheth the sightless eyes,before him the demons flee,to the dead he sayeth: arise
and that voice still soundeth on,from the centuries that are gone,to the centuries that shall be
the dowry of my sister cleopatra,when she was wed to ptolemy and now,won back and made more wonderful by me
they must have hippodromes and games and baths,stage-plays and festivals and most of all,the dionysia
have i not sacked the temple and on the altar,set up the statue of olympian zeus,to hellenize it
and who hath said it,who hath set in motion,that sorry jest
they shall be made to eat the flesh of swine,or they shall die,where are they
there let them stay and starve,till i am ready to make greeks of them,after my fashion
they shall stay and starve,my lord the ambassadors of samaria,await thy pleasure
only the royal sanction,to give a name unto a nameless temple,upon mount gerizim
your nameless temple shall receive the name,of jupiter hellenius,ye may go
t is of good augury,the rest will follow,till the whole land is hellenized
yesterday eleazer an old man,being fourscore years and ten chose rather death,by torture than to eat the flesh of swine
hundreds have fled already to the mountains,of ephraim where judas maccabaeus,hath raised the standard of revolt against thee
god looketh on us and hath comfort in us,as moses in his song of old declared,he in his servants shall be comforted
i knew thou wouldst not fail,he speaks no more,he is beyond all pain
it sounds to me as from another world,and makes the petty miseries of this,seem unto me as naught and less than naught
it is good o king,being put to death by men to look for hope,from god to be raised up again by him
this silence is more terrible to me,than any sound than any cry of pain,that might escape the lips of one who dies
wherefore art thou the only living thing,among thy brothers dead,art thou afraid
never will i obey the king's commandment,but the commandment of the ancient law,that was by moses given unto our fathers
ye both shall perish,by torments worse than any that your god,here or hereafter hath in store for me
thy footsteps will not wake them nor thy voice,nor wilt thou hear amid thy troubled dreams,thy children crying for thee in the night
none can escape from death,say that ye come,to die for israel and ye are welcome
the princes and the elders weep and wail,the young men and the maidens are made feeble,the beauty of the women hath been changed
both men and women die old men and young,old eleazer died: and mahala,with all her seven sons
to-day he shall be lifted up to-morrow,shall not be found because he is returned,unto his dust his thought has come to nothing
there is no peace between us nor can be,until this banner floats upon the walls,of our jerusalem
the power of god,whose breath shall scatter your white tents abroad,as flakes of snow
your mighty one in heaven,will not do battle on the seventh day,it is his day of rest
last night i dreamed a dream and in my vision,beheld onias our high-priest of old,who holding up his hands prayed for the jews
its hateful aspect,insults us with the bitter memories,of other days
lurking among the ruins of the temple,deep in its inner courts we found this man,clad as high-priest
i am thy prisoner judas maccabaeus,and it would ill become me to conceal,my name or office
what should prevent me now thou man of sin,from hanging at its side the head of one,who born a jew hath made himself a greek
when hast thou,at any time to any man or woman,or even to any little child shown mercy
i who made the jews,skip like the grasshoppers am made myself,to skip among these stones
my lord,i am a messenger from antioch,sent here by lysias
and then emmaus fell and then bethsura,ephron and all the towns of galaad,and maccabaeus marched to carnion
(throws up his hands and sinks into the,arms of attendants who lay him upon,a bank
thy people whom i judged to be unworthy,to be so much as buried shall be equal,unto the citizens of antioch
i will become a jew and will declare,through all the world that is inhabited,the power of god
bring here the royal litter,we will bear him,in to the camp while yet he lives
the old castle,needs not your presence,no one waits for you
yours a child's sorrow smiling through its tears,but mine the grief of an impassioned woman,who drank her life up in one draught of love
dreams or illusions call them what you will,they lift us from the commonplace of life,to better things
are there no brighter dreams,no higher aspirations than the wish,to please and to be pleased
and my cardinal,at itri in the courtyard of his palace,keeps a tame lion
and so counterfeits,st,mark the evangelist
and there vesuvius with its plume of smoke,and the great city stretched upon the shore,as in a dream
michael angelo's studio,he is at work on the cartoon of the,last judgment
that is the title they cajole me with,to make me do their work and leave my own,but having once begun i turn not back
rise from your graves drowsy and drugged with death,as men who suddenly aroused from sleep,look round amazed and know not where they are
so love the greatest emperor of them all,writes his in green at first but afterwards,in the imperial purple of our blood
it is kind of you,to come to us who linger here like gossips,wasting the afternoon in idle talk
pardon me gentlemen,but when i entered,i saw but the marchesa
but that,is not what occupies my thoughts at present,nor why i sent for you messer michele
i am doubtful,how i shall build how large to make the convent,and which way fronting
i see no bar nor drawback to this building,and on our homeward way if it shall please you,we may together view the site
the hours i count not,as a sun-dial but am like a clock,that tells the time as well by night as day
the very memory of all honest living,is wiped away and even our tuscan tongue,corrupted to a lombard dialect
baccio valori and philippo strozzi,once the duke's friends and intimates are with us,and cardinals salvati and ridolfi
we shall soon see then as valori says,whether the duke can best spare honest men,or honest men the duke
heaven help us all i will not tarry longer,for you have need of rest,good-night
fra bastiano how your portly presence,contrasts with that of the spare florentine,who has just left me
sung by the tenor of the papal choir,and in a papal mass seemed out of place,there's something wrong in it
t is a damascus blade you see the inscription,in arabic: la allah illa allah,there is no god but god
how beautiful,in fashion and in finish,it is perfect
i will keep it,in memory of the donor,many thanks
berni and ariosto both shall add,a canto to their poems and describe you,as furioso and innamorato
beware,i remember that bolsena's eels,and vernage wine once killed a pope of rome
t was a french pope and then so long ago,who knows,perhaps the story is not true
the night is far advanced,i fear to stay too late and weary you,with these discussions
dear countess,if loyalty to friendship be a claim,upon your confidence then i may claim it
but the inward life,that you know not 't is known but to myself,and is to me a mystery and a pain
yes your meditations,are more of this world and its vanities,than of the world to come
yet have i seen you listen,enraptured when fra bernardino preached,of faith and hope and charity
for i confess to live among my friends,is paradise to me my purgatory,is living among people i dislike
teach me then,to harmonize the discord of my life,and stop the painful jangle of these wires
that is a task impossible until,you tune your heart-strings to a higher key,than earthly melodies
but lead me privately so that the world,hear not my steps i would not give occasion,for talk among the people
do me the kindness then,to speak without reserve and with all frankness,if you divine the truth will i confess it
this warrants me in saying,you think you can win heaven by compromise,and not by verdict
hark,the convent bells,are ringing it is midnight i must leave you
i make you the same answer,that was not,a pledge of love but of pure gratitude
come to my arms and to my heart once more,my soul goes out to meet you and embrace you,for we are of the sisterhood of sorrow
let me look at you,what a joy it is,to see your face to hear your voice again
you shall hear all,but first sit down and listen patiently,while i confess myself
not a sin a folly,i chid you once at ischia when you told me,that brave fra bastian was to paint your portrait
old as i am i have at last consented,to the entreaties and the supplications,of michael angelo
no this is a friend,of yours as well as mine the lady julia,the duchess of trajetto
t is long since i have seen your face my lady,pardon me if i say that having seen it,one never can forget it
and now i come to add one labor more,if you will call that labor which is pleasure,and only pleasure
my dear maestro,have you then forgotten,the story of sophocles in his old age
t is an illusion,a fabulous story that will lead old men,into a thousand follies and conceits
it was of no great import nothing more,nor less than my late visit to ferrara,and what i saw there in the ducal palace
the men that women marry,and why they marry them will always be,a marvel and a mystery to the world
and then the duchess how shall i describe her,or tell the merits of that happy nature,which pleases most when least it thinks of pleasing
frost kills the flowers that blossom out of season,and these precocious intellects portend,a life of sorrow or an early death
and what poets,were there to sing you madrigals and praise,olympia's eyes and cherubina's tresses
silence and solitude the soul's best friends,are with me here and the tumultuous world,makes no more noise than the remotest planet
how damp and cold it was,how my bones ached,and my head reeled when i was working there
there is a charm,a certain something in the atmosphere,that all men feel and no man can describe
the figure vanished and there rose a cry,out of the darkness long and fierce and loud,with imprecations in all languages
say have you seen our friend fra bastian lately,since by a turn of fortune he became,friar of the signet
faith a pretty artist,to pass his days in stamping leaden seals,on papal bulls
be at it late and early persevere,and work right on through censure and applause,or else abandon art
no man works harder,then i do,i am not a moment idle
the god who made me,knows why he made me what i am a goldsmith,a mere artificer
i know my life is wasted and consumed,in vanities but i have better hours,and higher aspirations than you think
that was nothing,it did not kill me only lamed me slightly,i am quite well again
can you sit down in them,on summer afternoons and play the lute,or sing or sleep the time away
i have not time,did you meet benvenuto,as you came up the stair
i cannot go,the sibylline leaves of life,grow precious now when only few remain
i seem to hear her hearing the boughs and breezes,and leaves and birds lamenting and the waters,murmuring flee along the verdant herbage
i beg you to take note of what he says,about the papal seals for that concerns,your office and yourself
ah these old hands can fashion fairer shapes,in marble and can paint diviner pictures,since i have known her
his wealth is scattered to the winds his children,are long since dead but those celestial gates,survive and keep his name and memory green
sharp is the vinegar of sweet wine and sharp,the words you speak because the heart within you,is sweet unto the core
raphael is not dead,he doth but sleep for how can he be dead,who lives immortal in the hearts of men
he only drank the precious wine of youth,the outbreak of the grapes before the vintage,was trodden to bitterness by the feet of men
i have but words of praise and admiration,for his great genius and the world is fairer,that he lived in it
each one performs his life-work and then leaves it,those that come after him will estimate,his influence on the age in which he lived
so you have left at last your still lagoons,your city of silence floating in the sea,and come to us in rome
there are things in rome,that one might walk bare-footed here from venice,but to see once and then to die content
i felt so once but i have grown familiar,with desolation and it has become,no more a pain to me but a delight
and paints with fires,sudden and splendid as the lightning paints,the cloudy vault of heaven
indeed i know not,t was a foolish boast,and does no harm to any but himself
when you two,are gone who is there that remains behind,to seize the pencil falling from your fingers
i hear,your son orazio and your nephew marco,mentioned with honor
that acrisius did well,to lock such beauty in a brazen tower,and hide it from all eyes
and more that you were present,and saw the showery jove from high olympus,descend in all his splendor
messer michele all the arts are yours,not one alone and therefore i may venture,to put a question to you
how from the canvas they detach themselves,till they deceive the eye and one would say,it is a statue with a screen behind it
and now maestro i will say once more,how admirable i esteem your work,and leave you without further interruption
death is the chillness that precedes the dawn,we shudder for a moment then awake,in the broad sunshine of the other life
hand me the mirror,i would fain behold,what change comes o'er our features when we die
do you remember julia when we walked,one afternoon upon the castle terrace,at ischia on the day before you left me
oh do not speak of him,his sudden death,o'ercomes me now as it o'ercame me then
therefore be cautious,keep your secret thought,locked in your breast
not pale but whiter than the sheet of snows,that without wind on some fair hill-top lies,her weary body seemed to find repose
like a sweet slumber in her lovely eyes,when now the spirit was no longer there,was what is dying called by the unwise
how wonderful,the light upon her face,shines from the windows of another world
i must then the short-coming of my means,piece out by stepping forward as the spartan,was told to add a step to his short sword
death's lightnings strike to right and left of me,and like a ruined wall the world around me,crumbles away and i am left alone
when one pope dies another is soon made,and i can make a dozen cardinals,but cannot make one michael angelo
you cardinal salviati,are an old man,are you incapable
i have seen his model,and have approved it,but here comes the artist
beware of him,he may make persians of you,to carry burdens on your backs forever
come forward dear maestro,in these gardens,all ceremonies of our court are banished
how graciously,your holiness commiserates old age,and its infirmities
i would advise,your holiness not to cross it or not often,it is not safe
there is some mystery here,these cardinals,stand lowering at me with unfriendly eyes
deputies,of the commissioners and they complain,of insufficient light in the three chapels
monsignore,perhaps you do not know that in the vaulting,above there are to go three other windows
therefore i pray your holiness release me,take off from me the burden of this work,let me go back to florence
and the grasshopper,shall be a burden and desire shall fail,because man goeth unto his long home
i have had my dream,and cannot carry out my great conception,and put it into act
the same reason,that keeps you standing sentinel at your door,the air of this delicious summer morning
i say no news from florence: i am wrong,for benvenuto writes that he is coming,to be my guest in rome
ah,benvenuto,t is a masterpiece
tradition says that fifteen thousand men,were toiling for ten years incessantly,upon this amphitheatre
think you that i approve such cruelties,because i marvel at the architects,who built these walls and curved these noble arches
your work i say again is nobler work,in so far as its end and aim are nobler,and this is but a ruin like the rest
its vaulted passages are made the caverns,of robbers and are haunted by the ghosts,of murdered men
a certain man copernicus by name,sometime professor here in rome has whispered,it is the earth and not the sun that moves
half sunk beneath the horizon,and yet not gone,twelve years are a long while
ah generous master,how shall i e'er thank you,for such kind language
dear benvenuto,i recognized the latent genius in you,but feared your vices
a strange adventure,that could have happened to no man alive,but you my benvenuto
the grand duke cosimo now reigns supreme,all liberty is dead,ah woe is me
well now he writes to me that as a christian,he is ashamed of the unbounded freedom,with which i represent it
he says i show mankind that i am wanting,in piety and religion in proportion,as i profess perfection in my art
i represent the angels,without their heavenly glory and the saints,without a trace of earthly modesty
he is at home there and he ought to know,what men avert their eyes from in such places,from the last judgment chiefly i imagine
i will not think of it but let it pass,for a rude speech thrown at me in the street,as boys threw stones at dante
but i grow old and weak,what wilt thou do,when i am dead urbino
ay it will make thee rich,thou shalt not die,a beggar in a hospital
thou hast served michael angelo,remember,henceforward thou shalt serve no other master
i have just fled from it,it is beleaguered,by spanish troops led by the duke of alva
so he calls them,and yet in fact these bright angelic legions,are only german lutherans
there was of old a monk of wittenberg,who went to rome you may have heard of him,his name was luther and you know what followed
o death why is it i cannot portray,thy form and features,do i stand too near thee
you have been revelling with your boon companions,giorgio vasari and you come to me,at an untimely hour
his holiness desires to see again,the drawing you once showed him of the dome,of the basilica
ah me,ah me,what darkness of despair
our lives are rivers gliding free,to that unfathomed boundless sea,the silent grave
thither all earthly pomp and boast,roll to be swallowed up and lost,in one dark wave
did we but use it as we ought,this world would school each wandering thought,to its high state
faith wings the soul beyond the sky,up to that better world on high,for which we wait
wealth and the high estate of pride,with what untimely speed they glide,how soon depart
bid not the shadowy phantoms stay,the vassals of a mistress they,of fickle heart
these gifts in fortune's hands are found,her swift revolving wheel turns round,and they are gone
no rest the inconstant goddess knows,but changing and without repose,still hurries on
where are the high-born dames and where,their gay attire and jewelled hair,and odors sweet
where are the gentle knights that came,to kneel and breathe love's ardent flame,low at their feet
where is the mazy dance of old,the flowing robes inwrought with gold,the dancers wore
but o how false and full of guile,that world which wore so soft a smile,but to betray
she that had been his friend before,now from the fated monarch tore,her charms away
what was their prosperous estate,when high exalted and elate,with power and pride
what but a transient gleam of light,a flame which glaring at its height,grew dim and died
their deeds of mercy and of arms,in peaceful days or war's alarms,when thou dost show
o death thy stern and angry face,one stroke of thy all-powerful mace,can overthrow
to friends a friend how kind to all,the vassals of this ancient hall,and feudal fief
what prudence with the old and wise,what grace in youthful gayeties,in all how sage
benignant to the serf and slave,he showed the base and falsely brave,a lion's rage
his soul to him who gave it rose,god lead it to its long repose,its glorious rest
and though the warrior's sun has set,its light shall linger round us yet,bright radiant blest
clear fount of light,my native land on high,bright with a glory that shall never fade
mansion of truth,without a veil or shade,thy holy quiet meets the spirit's eye
heavenward the bright perfections i adore,direct and the sure promise cheers the way,that whither love aspires there shall my dwelling be
how without guile thy bosom all transparent,as the pure crystal lets the curious eye,thy secrets scan thy smooth round pebbles count
many a corpse is bathed in thee,both of moors and eke of christians,slain with swords most cruelly
the peasant leaves his plough afield,the reaper leaves his hook,and from his hand the shepherd-boy
the young set up a shout of joy,the old forget their years,the feeble man grows stout of heart
some day some day,o troubled breast,shalt thou find rest
lakes full many in number their mirror held up for the mountains,held for the forests up in whose depths the high-horned reindeers,had their kingly walk and drank of a hundred brooklets
mid these scattered now here and now there were numberless flocks of,sheep with fleeces white as thou seest the white-looking stray clouds,flock-wise spread o'er the heavenly vault when it bloweth in springtime
lately between the two on a bear-skin (the skin it was coal-black,scarlet-red was the throat but the paws were shodden with silver,thorsten sat with his friends hospitality sitting with gladness
oft when the moon through the cloudrack flew related the old man,wonders from distant lands he had seen and cruises of vikings,far away on the baltic and sea of the west and the white sea
midway the floor burned ever the fire-flame,glad on its stone-built hearth and thorough the wide-mouthed smoke-flue,looked the stars those heavenly friends down into the great hall
round the walls upon nails of steel were hanging in order,breastplate and helmet together and here and there among them,downward lightened a sword as in winter evening a star shoots
ever and anon went a maid round the hoard and filled up the drink-horns,ever she cast down her eyes and blushed in the shield her reflection,blushed too even as she this gladdened the drinking champions
now the huntsman's band is ready,hurrah,over hill and dale
frithiof listens hark,there sings a snow-white bird upon the bough,though no human eye beholds thee odin's eye beholds thee now
straight the ancient king awakens,sweet has been my sleep he said,pleasantly sleeps one in the shadow guarded by a brave man's blade
go not to the strand,ring with thy bride,after the stars spread their light through the sky
perhaps in the sand,washed up by the tide,the bones of the outlawed viking may lie
then quoth the king,t is mournful to hear,a man like a whimpering maiden cry
pentecost day of rejoicing had come,the church of the village,gleaming stood in the morning's sheen
on the spire of the bell,decked with a brazen cock the friendly flames of the spring-sun,glanced like the tongues of fire beheld by apostles aforetime
also the church within was adorned for this was the season,when the young their parents' hope and the loved-ones of heaven,should at the foot of the altar renew the vows of their baptism
but in front of the choir round the altar-piece painted by horberg,crept a garland gigantic and bright-curling tresses of angels,peeped like the sun from a cloud from out of the shadowy leaf-work
hark,then roll forth at once the mighty tones of the organ,hover like voices from god aloft like invisible spirits
friendly was he to behold and glad as the heralding angel,walked he among the crowds but still a contemplative grandeur,lay on his forehead as clear as on moss-covered gravestone a sunbeam
and to the children explained the holy the highest in few words,thorough yet simple and clear for sublimity always is simple,both in sermon and song a child can seize on its meaning
this is the hour of your trial the turning-point of existence,seed for the coming days without revocation departeth,now from your lips the confession bethink ye before ye make answer
kneeling he read then the prayers of the consecration and softly,with him the children read at the close with tremulous accents,asked he the peace of heaven a benediction upon them
sudden as struck from the clouds stood the teacher silent and laid his,hand on his forehead and cast his looks upward while thoughts high and holy,flew through the midst of his soul and his eyes glanced with wonderful brightness
tokens are dead if the things live not,the light everlasting,unto the blind is not but is born of the eye that has vision
decked like an altar before them there stood the green earth and above it,heaven opened itself as of old before stephen they saw there,radiant in glory the father and on his right hand the redeemer
north sea,a glimpse of wessel rent,thy murky sky
from denmark thunders tordenskiol,let each to heaven commend his soul,and fly
and amid pleasures and alarm,and war and victory be thine arms,my grave
now have i but their memory fondly cherished,god,may i never lose that too
hold your tongues,both swabian,and saxon
a bold bohemian cries,if there's a heaven upon this earth,in bohemia it lies
thou mayest stand on the mainmast tall,for full to sinking is my house,with merry companions all
whither o brooklet say i,thou hast with thy soft murmur,murmured my senses away
that can no murmur be,t is the water-nymphs that are singing,their roundelays under me
she can both false and friendly be,beware,beware
she gives a side-glance and looks down,beware,beware
and what she says it is not true,beware,beware
she knows how much it is best to show,beware,beware
it is a fool's-cap for thee to wear,beware,beware
and yet all our sorrowings,and all our rejoicings,thou dost feel them all
god hath wonders many,which we cannot fathom,placed within thy form
when the heart is sinking,thou alone canst raise it,trembling in the storm
should i speak it here,ye would stand aghast with fear,i am a prince of mighty sway
pale the children both did look,but the guest a beaker took,golden wine will make you whole
the children drank,gave many a courteous thank,o that draught was very cool
spake the grim guest,from his hollow cavernous breast,roses in the spring i gather
who leads us with a gentle hand,thither o thither,into the silent land
the graybeard with trembling hand obeys,a purple light shines over all,it beams from the luck of edenhall
o hemlock tree,o hemlock tree,how faithful are thy branches
o maiden fair,o maiden fair,how faithless is thy bosom
who has it not wants hardihood,who has it has much trouble and care,who once has had it has despair
whilom love was like a tire and warmth and comfort it bespoke,but alas,it now is quenched and only bites us like the smoke
ah,who would not then depart with gladness,to inherit heaven for earthly sadness
thou shalt not fail,but ah be never,false as thy father was to me
the men shoved off,men on their willing way,the bounden wood
god thanked they,that to them the sea-journey,easy had been
him the doubt disturbed,in his mind's thought,what these men might be
went then to the shore,on his steed riding,the thane of hrothgar
quickest is best,to make known,whence your coming may be
in the foulness of earth,thou all wearest away,like to the loam
with beast and bird the forest rings,each in his jargon cries or sings,and time throws off his cloak again
gentle spring,in sunshine clad,well dost thou thy power display
sweet babe,true portrait of thy father's face,sleep on the bosom that thy lips have pressed
awake and chase this fatal thought,unclose,thine eye but for one moment on the light
sweet error,he but slept i breathe again,come gentle dreams the hour of sleep beguile
but death steals on there is no hope of life,in paradise where almoners live again,there are our couches spread there shall we rest from pain
when he revived with a loud voice cried he,o heavenly father,holy saint marie
beloved france,how have the good and brave,been torn from thee and left thee weak and poor
when one beholds the dusky hedges blossom,a rustic bridal oh,how sweet it is
o no,for a maiden frail i trow,never bore so lofty a brow
she promises one a village swain,another a happy wedding-day,and the bride a lovely boy straightway
yet jane has named him not these three days past,arrived,yet keeps aloof so far
come,keep the promise of that happier day,that i may keep the faith to thee i plighted
i suffer,o my god,come make me glad
earth i forget and heaven and all distresses,when seated by my side my hand he presses,but when alone remember all
ah,woe is me,then bear me to my grave
away,he will return,i do but rave

already my slow steps had led me on,into the ancient wood so far that i,could see no more the place where i had entered

fortunate old man,here among familiar rivers,and these sacred founts shalt thou take the shadowy coolness
on this side a hedge along the neighboring cross-road,where hyblaean bees ever feed on the flower of the willow,often with gentle susurrus to fall asleep shall persuade thee
yonder beneath the high rock the pruner shall sing to the breezes,nor meanwhile shalt thy heart's delight the hoarse wood-pigeons,nor the turtle-dove cease to mourn from aerial elm-trees

think ye the guides will barter for lust of the light,the pride of an ancient people in warfare bred,honour of comrades living and faith to the dead

he laughed: if one may settle the score for five,i am ready but let the reckoning stand til day,i have loved the sunlight as dearly as any alive

twice three hundred boys were we,long ago long ago,where the downs look out to the severn sea
some were for profit and some for pride,long ago long ago,some for the flag they lived and died
but a lad there was to his fellows sang,long ago long ago,and soon the world to his music rang
for the voice ye hear is the voice of home,long ago long ago,and the voice of youth with the world to roam

the legions' iron tramp,the goths' wide-wandering camp,had these no fame that by thy shore might linger
then the songman flinging wide his songnet,on the last token laid his master's hand,none but dying men can understand
yonder sun that fierce and fiery-hearted,marches down the sky to vanish soon,rises pallid like the rainy moon
bid farewell to all that most thou lovest,tell thy heart thy living life is done,are not worth an hour of yonder sun

i saw her first abreast the boston light,at anchor she had just come in turned head,and sent her hawsers creaking clattering down
there in smoke-smudged coats,lay funnelled liners dirty fishing-craft,blunt cargo-luggers tugs and ferry-boats
often i think of you jimmy doane,you who light-heartedly came to my house,three autumns to shoot and to eat a grouse
as i sat apart in this quiet room,my mind was full of the horror of war,and not with the hope of a visitor
i had dined on food that had lost its taste,my soul was cold and i wished you were here,when all in a moment i knew you were near
placing that chair where you used to sit,i looked at my book: three years to-day,since you laughed in that seat and i heard you say
my country is with you whatever befall,america britain these two are akin,in courage and honour they underpin
you were comely and tall you had corded arms,and sympathy's grace with your strength was blent,you were generous clever and confident
there was that in your hopes which uncountable lives,have perished to make your heart was fulfilled,with the breath of god that can never be stilled
a living symbol of power you talked,of the work to do in the world to make,life beautiful: yes and my heartstrings ache
to think how you at the stroke of war,chose that your steadfast soul should fly,with the eagles of france as their proud ally
you were america's self dear lad,the first swift son of your bright free land,to heed the call of the inner command
to image its spirit in such rare deeds,as braced the valour of france who knows,that the heart of america thrills with her woes
brave man is its flower and symbol who,makes bold to utter the words that choke,the throats of feebler timider folk
you flew for the western eagle and fell,doing great things for your country's pride,for the beauty and peace of life you died
britain and france have shrined in their souls,your memory yes and for ever you share,their love with their perished lords of the air
invisible now in that empty seat,you sit who came through the clouds to me,swift as a message from over the sea
my house is always open to you,dear spirit come often and you will find,welcome where mind can foregather with mind
and may we sit together one day,quietly here when a word is said,to bring new gladness unto our dead
knowing your dream is a dream no more,and seeing on some momentous pact,your vision upbuilt as a deathless fact

has your last word of sophistry been said,o cult of slaves,then it is hers to speak
there is dust in my eyes for i cannot see,is that my michel to the right of thee,soldier of france
she said: now have i stayed too long in this my place of bliss,with these glad dead that comforted forget what sorrow is,upon that world whose stony stairs they climbed to come to this
but lo a cry hath torn the peace wherein so long i stayed,like a trumpet's call at heaven's wall from a herald unafraid,a million voices in one cry 'where is the maid the maid
i had forgot from too much joy that olden task of mine,but i have heard a certain word shatter the chant divine,have watched a banner glow and grow before mine eyes for sign
i would return to that my land flung in the teeth of war,i would cast down my robe and crown that pleasure me no more,and don the armor that i knew the valiant sword i bore
and angels militant shall fling the gates of heaven wide,and souls new-dead whose lives were shed like leaves on war's red tide,shall cross their swords above our heads and cheer us as we ride
for with me goes that soldier saint saint michael of the sword,and i shall ride on his right side a page beside his lord,and men shall follow like swift blades to reap a sure reward
grant that i answer this my call yea though the end may be,the naked shame the biting flame the last long agony,i would go singing down that road where fagots wait for me

[since the bombardment of strasburg august her statue in,paris representing alsace has been draped in mourning by the french,people
qui vive,who comes,what approaches there
low and brown barns thatched and repatched and tattered,where i had seven sons until to-day,a little hill of hay your spur has scattered
man the whole globe in gold were no repayment,for what you have lost,and how shall i repay
long wert thou saddest of the nations wed,to sorrow as the fire to the flame,not yet relentless history had writ of teuton shame
land of new hope no more the minor key,no more the songs of exile long and lone,thy tears henceforth be tears of memory
forever let the equal record stand,a thousand winters for this spring of springs,that to a warring world through thee millennial longing brings

but hark,what sound the ear dismays,mine italy mine italy
so the morning flung her cloak,through the hanging pall of smoke,trimmed with red it was and dripping with a deep and angry stain
and the day came walking then,through a lane of murdered men,and her light fell down before her like a cross upon the plain
nursed on their mothers' bosoms now they lie,a golgotha all shattered torn and sped,a mountain for these royal feet to tread
guns of verdun answer then,sisters when to guard lorraine,gunners lay you east again
heard ye the trumpet sound,the day,the day
england the mother-aerie of our brood,that on the summit of dominion stood,shakes in the blast: heaven battles overhead
and westward borne that planetary sweep,darkening o'er england and her times to be,already steps upon the ocean-deep
watch well my country that unearthly sea,lest when thou thinkest not and in thy sleep,unapt for war that gloom enshadow thee
in treason to the world you are enthroned,we rise and by the yet ungathered dead,not lightly shall the treason be atoned
and the hours too tardy-footed pass,the voiceless hush grows dense,mid the imaginings alas
there there,hearken how my bells in the air,drive away care
there now,he goes,old bones i've wearied him
who would have then divined that dead would lie,like swaths of grain beneath the harvest moon,upon these lands the ancient belgae held
thus do our facile seers foretell,the truth that none can buy or sell,and e'en the wisest must ignore
will it be heaven,will it be hell,when there is peace
and we who deemed him wise,we who believed that thou wast dead,how should we seek thine eyes
let us fight fair for our own best or worst,so gentlemen of the guard,fire first
relentless savage hot and grim the infuriate columns press,where terror simulates disdain and danger is largess,where greedy youth claims death for bride and agony seems bliss
ride cossacks ride,charge turcos charge,the fateful hour has come
the superman has burst his bonds,with kultur-flag unfurled,and prayer on lip he runs amuck imperilling the world
and shut the strife in darkness: all was still,then slowly crept a triumph on the dark,and i heard beauty singing up the hill
i have heard the townsfolk come,i have heard the roll and thunder of the nearest drum,as the drummer stopped and cried hear
be strong,the summons comes,prepare
and there was calm in my heart of the desert of the dead sea,of vast plains of the west before the coming storm,and there was calm in their eyes like the last calm that shall be
they seem to be walking in dreams,they seem not to know,it is their homes their happiness vanishing so
they sang an old war-song,i have heard it often in other days,but never before when war was walking the world's highways
half a thousand dead men soon shall hear and see,we're a band,said the weary big dragoon
and if he sees as clearly,as i do where her shrine,must fall he longs as dearly
it's a cot and a hospital ward for me,but i'll tell 'em in blighty wherever i be,how the guards came through
but here you are at last and the sight is good for our eyes,glad to welcome you up and out of the caves of the sea,and ready for sale or barter whatever your will may be
the captain of the submersible,oh do not be impatient good friends of this neutral land,that we have been so tardy in reaching your eager strand
they chose and the women and children that are greeting you here are,those,ghosts of the women and children that the rest of the hundred chose
come come get down to business,for time is money you know,and you must make up in both to us for having been so slow

and i thought of my beautiful paris and gave a last look at the land,at france my belle france in her glory of blue sky and green field,and wood
death with honor but never surrender,and to die with such men it was,good
and poured them molten from thy tragic towers,now are the windows dust that were thy flower,patterned like frost petalled like asphodels
full sixty yards i've seen them throw,with all that nicety of aim,they learned on british cricket-fields
shouts back the sound of mirth,tramp of feet and lilt of song,ringing all the road along
when cheeks are flushed and glasses gilt and pearled,with the sweet wine of france that concentrates,the sunshine and the beauty of the world
o the fading eyes the grimed face turned bony,oped mouth gushing fallen head,lessening pressure of a hand shrunk clammed and stony
we are here in a wood of little beeches,and the leaves are like black lace,against a sky of nacre
goaded like the damned by some invisible wrath,a will stronger than weariness stronger than animal fear,implacable and monotonous
almost at unawares savagely and strewn,in bloody fragments to be the carrion,of rats and crows
choked with wild weeds and overgrown,with rank grass all torn and rent,by war's opposing engines strewn
not only unto thee across the narrow sea,but from the loneliest vale in the last land's heart,the sad-eyed watching mother sees her sons depart
the glass is dim we see not wisely far nor well,but bred of english bone and reared on freedom's wine,all that we have and are we lay on england's shrine
the sentry stands his limbs with cold congealed,his head a-nod with sleep he cannot yield,though sleep and snow in deadly force unite
the soil of france,fat fields and green that bred my,blood and bone
with these we hold in soul and heart,with these we choose our lot and part,till liberty is safe on sea and shore
the fresh cold wind of dawn blows on my face,as in the sun's raw heart i swiftly fly,and watch the seas glide by
oh down by millwall basin as i went the other day,i met a skipper that i knew and to him i did say,now what's the cargo captain that brings you up this way
and if it's sweeping mines,or hanging out with booby-traps for the skulking submarines,i'm here to do my blooming best and give the beggars beans
a rough job and a tough job is the best job for me,and what or where i don't much care i'll take what it may be,for a tight place is the right place when it's foul weather at sea
what matter,on the winning of a goal,you staked your soul
perhaps 't was pluck,that hardened him a man among the men,perhaps
hell,but one was hit,and tumbling like a pigeon plump
as we ebbed with the battle-tide,fingers of red-hot steel,suddenly closed on my side
i crawled on my hands and lay,where a shallow crater yawned wide,then i swooned
his words i already foreknew,these are old wounds said he,but of late they have troubled me
the wounded canadian speaks,my leg,it's off at the knee
i'm gay,you bet i am gay,but i wasn't a while ago
what has happened since then,since i lay with my face to the wall,the most despairing of men
so over the blanket's rim,i raised my terrible face,and i saw how i envied him
then i stopped for lo,she was there,and a great light shone in her eyes
they sent him back to her,the letter came,saying
wasn't she glad now,everything seemed won,and all the rest for them permissible ease
blow bugles blow,they brought us for our dearth,holiness lacked so long and love and pain
the years had given them kindness,dawn was theirs,and sunset and the colours of the earth
and your bright promise withered long and sped,is touched stirs rises opens and grows sweet,and blossoms and is you when you are dead
not one of these poor men who died,but did within his soul believe,that death for thee was glorified
so young they were so strong and well,until the bitter summons fell,too young to die
so beautiful their bodies were,built with so exquisite a care,so young and fit and lithe and fair
yet now so pitiful they lie,where love of country bade them hie,to fight this fierce caprice and die
we can but give our tears,ye dead men who shall bring you,fame in the coming years
back from the trenches more dead than alive,stone-deaf and dazed and with a broken knee,he hobbled slowly muttering vacantly
we fell we lay we slumbered we took rest,with the wild nerves quiet at last and the vexed brain,freed of the heavy dreams of hearts afar
and what do you call it,asked one,i thought i was dead
and over the wide field friend and foe,spoke of small things remembering not old woe,of war and hunger hatred and fierce words
they sat and listened to the brooks and birds,and watched the starlight perish in pale flame,wondering what god would look like when he came
we laughed and paid the forfeit glad to pay,being recompensed beyond our sacrifice,with that nor death nor time can take away
but wherever they lie an english rose,so red and a lily of france so pale,will grow for a love that never and never can fail
yes so we called you then,you far more wise,than to give life to men
look look down,and gather the blinded oceans,moon of compassion
light of light grant them eternal peace,and let light perpetual shine upon them,light everlasting
in flooded trench half numb to cold or pain,or marching through the desert sand,to some dread place that they may never gain
though death may lurk in any tree or hill,his brave young spirit is their stay,trusting in that they'll follow where he will
your son and my son the downy things,sheltered in mother's breast by mother's wings,should they be broken in the lord's wars peace

as i lay with my head in your lap camerado,the confession i made i resume what i said to you and the open air i,resume
to speak,to walk,to seize something by the hand
o setting sun,though the time has come,i still warble under you unmitigated adoration
when i peruse the conquered fame of heroes and the victories of mighty,generals i do not envy the generals,nor the president in his presidency nor the rich in his great house
when lilacs last in the door-yard bloomed,and the great star early drooped in the western sky in the night,i mourned
solitary the thrush,the hermit withdrawn to himself avoiding the settlements,sings by himself a song
lo,body and soul,this land
from deep secluded recesses,from the fragrant cedars and the ghostly pines so still,came the singing of the bird
and the charm of the singing rapt me,as i held as if by their hands my comrades in the night,and the voice of my spirit tallied the song of the bird
when it is so when thou hast taken them i joyously sing the dead,lost in the loving floating ocean of thee,laved in the flood of thy bliss o death
to the tally of my soul,loud and strong kept up the grey-brown bird,with pure deliberate notes spreading filling the night
loud in the pines and cedars dim,clear in the freshness moist and the swamp-perfume,and i with my comrades there in the night
i saw battle-corpses myriads of them,and the white skeletons of young men i saw them,i saw the debris and debris of all dead soldiers
must i pass from my song for thee,from my gaze on thee in the west fronting the west communing with thee,o comrade lustrous with silver face in the night
o captain,my captain,our fearful trip is done
but o heart,heart,heart
leave you not the little spot,where on the deck my captain lies,fallen cold and dead
o captain,my captain,rise up and hear the bells
but i with silent tread,walk the spot my captain lies,fallen cold and dead
for we cannot tarry here,we must march my darlings we must bear the brunt of danger,we the youthful sinewy races all the rest on us depend
we take up the task eternal and the burden and the lesson,pioneers,o pioneers
o i mourn and yet exult i am rapt with love for all,pioneers,o pioneers
then upon the march we fittest die soon and sure the gap is filled,pioneers,o pioneers
never must you be divided in our ranks you move united,pioneers,o pioneers
soon i hear you coming warbling soon you rise and tramp amid us,pioneers,o pioneers
still be ours the diet hard and the blanket on the ground,pioneers,o pioneers
was the road of late so toilsome,did we stop discouraged nodding on our,way
yet a passing hour i yield you in your tracks to pause oblivious,pioneers,o pioneers
were you thinking that those were the words those upright lines,those,curves angles dots
no those are not the words the substantial words are in the ground and,sea,they are in the air they are in you
were you thinking that those were the words those delicious sounds out of,your friends' mouths,no the real words are more delicious than they
the workmanship of souls is by the inaudible words of the earth,the great masters know the earth's words and use them more than the,audible words
whoever you are,motion and reflection are especially for you,the divine ship sails the divine sea for you
each man to himself and each woman to herself such as the word of the,past and present and the word of immortality,no one can acquire for another not one
the song is to the singer and comes back most to him,the teaching is to the teacher and comes back most to him,the murder is to the murderer and comes back most to him
this is a poem for the sayers of words these are hints of meanings,these are they that echo the tones of souls and the phrases of souls,if they did not echo the phrases of souls what were they then
delve,mould,pile the words of the earth
work on it is materials you bring not breaths,work on age after age,nothing is to be lost
now i make a leaf of voices for i have found nothing mightier than they,are,and i have found that no word spoken but is beautiful in its place
surely whoever speaks to me in the right voice him or her i shall follow,as the water follows the moon silently with fluid steps anywhere around,the globe
all waits for the right voices,where is the practised and perfect organ,where is the developed soul
whoever you are now i place my hand upon you that you be my poem,i whisper with my lips close to your ear,i have loved many women and men but i love none better than you
the race is never separated nor man nor woman escapes,all is inextricable things spirits nature nations you too from,precedents you come
think of the time when you was not yet born,think of times you stood at the side of the dying,think of the time when your own body will be dying
think of spiritual results,sure as the earth swims through the heavens does every one of its objects,pass into spiritual results
think of womanhood and you to be a woman,the creation is womanhood,have i not said that womanhood involves all
with gathering murk with muttering thunder and lambent shoots we all duly,awake south north east west inland and seaboard we will,surely awake
tears,tears,tears
youth large lusty loving youth full of grace force fascination,do you know that old age may come after you with equal grace force,fascination
the perfect judge fears nothing he could go front to front before god,before the perfect judge all shall stand back life and death shall stand,back heaven and hell shall stand back
great is life real and mystical wherever and whoever,great is death sure as life holds all parts together death holds all,parts together
him all wait for him all yield up to his word is decisive and final,him they accept in him lave in him perceive themselves as amid light,him they immerse and he immerses them
he is the answerer,what can be answered he answers and what cannot be answered he shows how,it cannot be answered
his welcome is universal the flow of beauty is not more welcome or,universal than he is,the person he favours by day or sleeps with at night is blessed
he walks with perfect ease in the capitol,he walks among the congress and one representative says to another here,is our equal appearing and new
the english believe he comes of their english stock,a jew to the jew he seems a russ to the russ usual and near removed from,none
the living look upon the corpse with their eyesight,but without eyesight lingers a different living and looks curiously on the,corpse
i see one building the house that serves him a few years or seventy or,eighty years at most,i see one building the house that serves him longer than that
your farm profits crops to think how engrossed you are,to think there will still be farms profits crops yet for you of what,avail
the preparations have every one been justified,the orchestra have sufficiently tuned their instruments the baton has,given the signal
do you suspect death,if i were to suspect death i should die now,do you think i could walk pleasantly and well-suited toward annihilation
old age alarmed uncertain a young woman's voice appealing to me for,comfort,a young man's voice shall i not escape
fair fearful wreck,tenement of a soul,itself a soul
from all the rest i single out you having a message for you,you are to die let others tell you what they please i cannot prevaricate,i am exact and merciless but i love you there is no escape for you
[footnote : the reader will share my wish that whitman had written,sanctus spiritus which is right instead of santa spirita which is,methodically wrong
divine instinct breadth of vision the law of reason health rudeness of,body withdrawnness gaiety sun-tan air-sweetness such are some,of the words of poems
the sailor and traveller underlie the maker of poems,the builder geometer chemist anatomist phrenologist artist all these,underlie the maker of poems
i will make divine magnetic lands,with the love of comrades,with the life-long love of comrades
as i walk solitary unattended,the announcements of recognised things science,the approved growth of cities and the spread of inventions
i see the ships,the vast factories with their foremen and workmen,and hear the endorsement of all and do not object to it
but i too announce solid things,science ships politics cities factories are not nothing they serve,they stand for realities all is as it should be
as nearing departure,as the time draws nigh glooming a cloud,a dread beyond of i know not what darkens me
camerado,this is no book,who touches this touches a man
i will give you all my keys,you shall enter as you please,as you please shall go again
when i hear you jingling through,all the chambers of my soul,how i sit and laugh at you
(tears and dreams for them for me,bitter science the exams,are near
death in whose service is nothing of gladness takes,me,for the lips and the eyes of god are behind a veil
when i move the oars love,see how the stars are tossed,distorted the brightest lost
there did you see,that spark fly up at us even,stars are not safe in heaven
a come and go of march-day loves,through the flower-vine trailing screen,a fluttering in of doves
fluent active figures of men pass along the railway,and i am woken,from the dreams that the distance flattered
you are always asking do i remember remember,the butter-cup bog-end where the flowers rose up,and kindled you over deep with a cast of gold
you ask again do the healing days close up,the open darkness which then drew us in,the dark which then drank up our brimming cup
and yes thank god it still is possible,the healing days shall close the darkness up,wherein we fainted like a smoke or dew
now who will burn you free,from your body's terrors and dross,since the fire has failed in me
tis the sun who asks the question in a lovely haste,for wisdom,what a lovely haste for wisdom is in men
and oh behind the cloud-sheaves like yellow autumn,dapples,did you see the wicked sun that winked
i have fetched the tears up out of the little wells,scooped them up with small iron words,dripping over the runnels
the harsh cold wind of my words drove on and still,i watched the tears on the guilty cheek of the boys,glitter and spill
if i could have put you in my heart,if but i could have wrapped you in myself,how glad i should have been
and oh that you had never never been,some of your selves my love that some,of your several faces i had never seen
nay but she sleeps like a bride and dreams her,dreams,of perfect things
she lies at last the darling in the shape of her dream,and her dead mouth sings,by its shape like the thrushes in clear evenings
two and two are the folk that walk,they pass in a half embrace,with dark face leaning to face
so i am not lonely nor sad,although bereaved of you,my little love
i move among a kinsfolk clad,with words but the dream shows through,as they move
earth of my swaying atmosphere,substance of my inconstant breath,i cannot but cleave to you
your presence peering lonelily there,oppresses me so i can hardly bear,to share the train with you
yet closely bitten in to me,is this armour of stiff reluctancy,that keeps me impounded
for i ache most earnestly for your touch,yet i cannot move however much,i would be your lover
will you open the amorous aching bud,of my body and loose the burning flood,that would leap to you from my heart
she clung to the door in her haste to enter,entered and quickly cast,it shut behind her leaving the street aghast
oh let us here forget let us take the sheer,unknown that lies before us bearing the ark,of the covenant onwards where she cannot go
do i not know the darkness within them,what,are they but shrouds
runs like a fretted arc-lamp into light,stirred by conflict to shining which else,were dark and whole with the night
runs to a fret of speed like a racing wheel,which else were aslumber along with the whole,of the dark swinging rhythmic instead of a-reel
leaps like a fountain of blue sparks leaping,in a jet from out of obscurity,which erst was darkness sleeping
runs into streams of bright blue drops,water and stones and stars and myriads,of twin-blue eyes and crops
of floury grain and all the hosts of day,all lovely hosts of ripples caused by fretting,the darkness into play
then suddenly she looked up,and i was blind in a tawny-gold day,till she took her eyes away
so i held my heart aloft,to the cuckoo that hung like a dove,and she settled soft
i echoed with surprise,hearing my mere lips shout,the answer they did devise
mournfully to and fro to and fro the trees are,waving,what did you say my dear
one lonely bell one only the storm-tossed afternoon,is braving,why not let it ring
a wet bird walks on the lawn call to the boy to come,and look,yes it is over now
he cannot see it i can never show it him how it,shook,don't disturb him darling
i look at the swaling sunset,and wish i could go also,through the red doors beyond the black-purple bar
then i would turn round,and seeing my cast-off body lying like lumber,i would laugh with joy
out of the darkness fretted sometimes in its sleeping,jets of sparks in fountains of blue come leaping,to sight revealing a secret numberless secrets keeping
sometimes the darkness trapped within a wheel,runs into speed like a dream the blue of the steel,showing the rocking darkness now a-reel
and all the manifold blue and joyous eyes,the rainbow arching over in the skies,new sparks of wonder opening in surprise

inferno,purgatorio,paradiso
io non so ben ridir com' i' v'intrai,tant' era pien di sonno a quel punto,che la verace via abbandonai
allor fu la paura un poco queta,che nel lago del cor m'era durata,la notte ch'i' passai con tanta pieta
e come quei che con lena affannata,uscito fuor del pelago a la riva,si volge a l'acqua perigliosa e guata
ed ecco quasi al cominciar de l'erta,una lonza leggera e presta molto,che di pel macolato era coverta
questa mi porse tanto di gravezza,con la paura ch'uscia di sua vista,ch'io perdei la speranza de l'altezza
mentre ch'i' rovinava in basso loco,dinanzi a li occhi mi si fu offerto,chi per lungo silenzio parea fioco
tu se' lo mio maestro e 'l mio autore,tu se' solo colui da cu' io tolsi,lo bello stilo che m'ha fatto onore
vedi la bestia per cu' io mi volsi,aiutami da lei famoso saggio,ch'ella mi fa tremar le vene e i polsi
ove udirai le disperate strida,vedrai li antichi spiriti dolenti,ch'a la seconda morte ciascun grida
lo giorno se n'andava e l'aere bruno,toglieva li animai che sono in terra,da le fatiche loro e io sol uno
non pare indegno ad omo d'intelletto,ch'e' fu de l'alma roma e di suo impero,ne l'empireo ciel per padre eletto
la quale e 'l quale a voler dir lo vero,fu stabilita per lo loco santo,u' siede il successor del maggior piero
per quest' andata onde li dai tu vanto,intese cose che furon cagione,di sua vittoria e del papale ammanto
per che se del venire io m'abbandono,temo che la venuta non sia folle,se' savio intendi me' ch'i' non ragiono
i' son beatrice che ti faccio andare,vegno del loco ove tornar disio,amor mi mosse che mi fa parlare
ma dimmi la cagion che non ti guardi,de lo scender qua giuso in questo centro,de l'ampio loco ove tornar tu ardi
da che tu vuo' saver cotanto a dentro,dirotti brievemente mi rispuose,perch' i' non temo di venir qua entro
questa chiese lucia in suo dimando,e disse: or ha bisogno il tuo fedele,di te e io a te lo raccomando
lucia nimica di ciascun crudele,si mosse e venne al loco dov' i' era,che mi sedea con l'antica rachele
non odi tu la pieta del suo pianto,non vedi tu la morte che 'l combatte,su la fiumana ove 'l mar non ha vanto
al mondo non fur mai persone ratte,a far lor pro o a fuggir lor danno,com' io dopo cotai parole fatte
poscia che tai tre donne benedette,curan di te ne la corte del cielo,e 'l mio parlar tanto ben ti promette
quali fioretti dal notturno gelo,chinati e chiusi poi che 'l sol li 'mbianca,si drizzan tutti aperti in loro stelo
tal mi fec' io di mia virtude stanca,e tanto buono ardire al cor mi corse,ch'i' cominciai come persona franca
dinanzi a me non fuor cose create,se non etterne e io etterno duro,lasciate ogne speranza voi ch'intrate
noi siam venuti al loco ov' i' t'ho detto,che tu vedrai le genti dolorose,c'hanno perduto il ben de l'intelletto
e poi che la sua mano a la mia puose,con lieto volto ond' io mi confortai,mi mise dentro a le segrete cose
quivi sospiri pianti e alti guai,risonavan per l'aere sanza stelle,per ch'io al cominciar ne lagrimai
diverse lingue orribili favelle,parole di dolore accenti d'ira,voci alte e fioche e suon di man con elle
facevano un tumulto il qual s'aggira,sempre in quell' aura sanza tempo tinta,come la rena quando turbo spira
fama di loro il mondo esser non lassa,misericordia e giustizia li sdegna,non ragioniam di lor ma guarda e passa
e io che riguardai vidi una 'nsegna,che girando correva tanto ratta,che d'ogne posa mi parea indegna
poscia ch'io v'ebbi alcun riconosciuto,vidi e conobbi l'ombra di colui,che fece per viltade il gran rifiuto
incontanente intesi e certo fui,che questa era la setta d'i cattivi,a dio spiacenti e a' nemici sui
questi sciaurati che mai non fur vivi,erano ignudi e stimolati molto,da mosconi e da vespe ch'eran ivi
elle rigavan lor di sangue il volto,che mischiato di lagrime a' lor piedi,da fastidiosi vermi era ricolto
allor con li occhi vergognosi e bassi,temendo no 'l mio dir li fosse grave,infino al fiume del parlar mi trassi
non isperate mai veder lo cielo,i' vegno per menarvi a l'altra riva,ne le tenebre etterne in caldo e 'n gelo
quinci fuor quete le lanose gote,al nocchier de la livida palude,che 'ntorno a li occhi avea di fiamme rote
ma quell' anime ch'eran lasse e nude,cangiar colore e dibattero i denti,ratto che 'nteser le parole crude
bestemmiavano dio e lor parenti,l'umana spezie e 'l loco e 'l tempo e 'l seme,di lor semenza e di lor nascimenti
poi si ritrasser tutte quante insieme,forte piangendo a la riva malvagia,ch'attende ciascun uom che dio non teme
caron dimonio con occhi di bragia,loro accennando tutte le raccoglie,batte col remo qualunque s'adagia
come d'autunno si levan le foglie,l'una appresso de l'altra fin che 'l ramo,vede a la terra tutte le sue spoglie
similemente il mal seme d'adamo,gittansi di quel lito ad una ad una,per cenni come augel per suo richiamo
e l'occhio riposato intorno mossi,dritto levato e fiso riguardai,per conoscer lo loco dov' io fossi
oscura e profonda era e nebulosa,tanto che per ficcar lo viso a fondo,io non vi discernea alcuna cosa
quivi secondo che per ascoltare,non avea pianto mai che di sospiri,che l'aura etterna facevan tremare
e s'e' furon dinanzi al cristianesmo,non adorar debitamente a dio,e di questi cotai son io medesmo
per tai difetti non per altro rio,semo perduti e sol di tanto offesi,che sanza speme vivemo in disio
e altri molti e feceli beati,e vo' che sappi che dinanzi ad essi,spiriti umani non eran salvati
non lasciavam l'andar perch' ei dicessi,ma passavam la selva tuttavia,la selva dico di spiriti spessi
non era lunga ancor la nostra via,di qua dal sonno quand' io vidi un foco,ch'emisperio di tenebre vincia
da ch'ebber ragionato insieme alquanto,volsersi a me con salutevol cenno,e 'l mio maestro sorrise di tanto
questo passammo come terra dura,per sette porte intrai con questi savi,giugnemmo in prato di fresca verdura
vidi cammilla e la pantasilea,da l'altra parte vidi 'l re latino,che con lavina sua figlia sedea
la sesta compagnia in due si scema,per altra via mi mena il savio duca,fuor de la queta ne l'aura che trema
dico che quando l'anima mal nata,li vien dinanzi tutta si confessa,e quel conoscitor de le peccata
la bufera infernal che mai non resta,mena li spirti con la sua rapina,voltando e percotendo li molesta
elena vedi per cui tanto reo,tempo si volse e vedi 'l grande achille,che con amore al fine combatteo
quali colombe dal disio chiamate,con l'ali alzate e ferme al dolce nido,vegnon per l'aere dal voler portate
di quel che udire e che parlar vi piace,noi udiremo e parleremo a voi,mentre che 'l vento come fa ci tace
siede la terra dove nata fui,su la marina dove 'l po discende,per aver pace co' seguaci sui
amor ch'al cor gentil ratto s'apprende,prese costui de la bella persona,che mi fu tolta e 'l modo ancor m'offende
amor condusse noi ad una morte,caina attende chi a vita ci spense,queste parole da lor ci fuor porte
ma dimmi: al tempo d'i dolci sospiri,a che e come concedette amore,che conosceste i dubbiosi disiri
noi leggiavamo un giorno per diletto,di lancialotto come amor lo strinse,soli eravamo e sanza alcun sospetto
novi tormenti e novi tormentati,mi veggio intorno come ch'io mi mova,e ch'io mi volga e come che io guati
grandine grossa acqua tinta e neve,per l'aere tenebroso si riversa,pute la terra che questo riceve
li occhi ha vermigli la barba unta e atra,e 'l ventre largo e unghiate le mani,graffia li spirti ed iscoia ed isquatra
urlar li fa la pioggia come cani,de l'un de' lati fanno a l'altro schermo,volgonsi spesso i miseri profani
quando ci scorse cerbero il gran vermo,le bocche aperse e mostrocci le sanne,non avea membro che tenesse fermo
voi cittadini mi chiamaste ciacco,per la dannosa colpa de la gola,come tu vedi a la pioggia mi fiacco
giusti son due e non vi sono intesi,superbia invidia e avarizia sono,le tre faville c'hanno i cuori accesi
quali dal vento le gonfiate vele,caggiono avvolte poi che l'alber fiacca,tal cadde a terra la fiera crudele
ahi giustizia di dio,tante chi stipa,nove travaglie e pene quant' io viddi
poi si volgea ciascun quand' era giunto,per lo suo mezzo cerchio a l'altra giostra,e io ch'avea lo cor quasi compunto
assai la voce lor chiaro l'abbaia,quando vegnono a' due punti del cerchio,dove colpa contraria li dispaia
questi fuor cherci che non han coperchio,piloso al capo e papi e cardinali,in cui usa avarizia il suo soperchio
in etterno verranno a li due cozzi,questi resurgeranno del sepulcro,col pugno chiuso e questi coi crin mozzi
mal dare e mal tener lo mondo pulcro,ha tolto loro e posti a questa zuffa,qual ella sia parole non ci appulcro
or puoi figliuol veder la corta buffa,d'i ben che son commessi a la fortuna,per che l'umana gente si rabbuffa
che permutasse a tempo li ben vani,di gente in gente e d'uno in altro sangue,oltre la difension d'i senni umani
noi ricidemmo il cerchio a l'altra riva,sovr' una fonte che bolle e riversa,per un fossato che da lei deriva
e io che di mirare stava inteso,vidi genti fangose in quel pantano,ignude tutte con sembiante offeso
queste si percotean non pur con mano,ma con la testa e col petto e coi piedi,troncandosi co' denti a brano a brano
lo duca mio discese ne la barca,e poi mi fece intrare appresso lui,e sol quand' io fui dentro parve carca
fossero,ch'entro l'affoca le dimostra rosse,come tu vedi in questo basso inferno
noi pur giugnemmo dentro a l'alte fosse,che vallan quella terra sconsolata,le mura mi parean che ferro fosse
va per lo regno de la morta gente,e 'l savio mio maestro fece segno,di voler lor parlar segretamente
chiuser le porte que' nostri avversari,nel petto al mio segnor che fuor rimase,e rivolsesi a me con passi rari
ma nondimen paura il suo dir dienne,perch' io traeva la parola tronca,forse a peggior sentenzia che non tenne
di poco era di me la carne nuda,ch'ella mi fece intrar dentr' a quel muro,per trarne un spirto del cerchio di giuda
e con idre verdissime eran cinte,serpentelli e ceraste avien per crine,onde le fiere tempie erano avvinte
o voi ch'avete li 'ntelletti sani,mirate la dottrina che s'asconde,sotto 'l velame de li versi strani
li rami schianta abbatte e porta fori,dinanzi polveroso va superbo,e fa fuggir le fiere e li pastori
come le rane innanzi a la nimica,biscia per l'acqua si dileguan tutte,fin ch'a la terra ciascuna s'abbica
dal volto rimovea quell' aere grasso,menando la sinistra innanzi spesso,e sol di quell' angoscia parea lasso
ahi quanto mi parea pien di disdegno,venne a la porta e con una verghetta,l'aperse che non v'ebbe alcun ritegno
che giova ne le fata dar di cozzo,cerbero vostro se ben vi ricorda,ne porta ancor pelato il mento e 'l gozzo
dentro li 'ntrammo sanz' alcuna guerra,e io ch'avea di riguardar disio,la condizion che tal fortezza serra
com' io fui dentro l'occhio intorno invio,e veggio ad ogne man grande campagna,piena di duolo e di tormento rio
la gente che per li sepolcri giace,potrebbesi veder,tutt' i coperchi e nessun guardia face
suo cimitero da questa parte hanno,con epicuro tutti suoi seguaci,che l'anima col corpo morta fanno
allor surse a la vista scoperchiata,un'ombra lungo questa infino al mento,credo che s'era in ginocchie levata
dicesti elli ebbe,non viv' elli ancora,non fiere li occhi suoi lo dolce lume
ma non cinquanta volte fia raccesa,la faccia de la donna che qui regge,che tu saprai quanto quell' arte pesa
el par che voi veggiate se ben odo,dinanzi quel che 'l tempo seco adduce,e nel presente tenete altro modo
indi s'ascose e io inver' l'antico,poeta volsi i passi ripensando,a quel parlar che mi parea nemico
appresso mosse a man sinistra il piede,lasciammo il muro e gimmo inver' lo mezzo,per un sentier ch'a una valle fiede
e quivi per l'orribile soperchio,del puzzo che 'l profondo abisso gitta,ci raccostammo in dietro ad un coperchio
morte per forza e ferute dogliose,nel prossimo si danno e nel suo avere,ruine incendi e tollette dannose
onde omicide e ciascun che mal fiere,guastatori e predon tutti tormenta,lo giron primo per diverse schiere
questo modo di retro par ch'incida,pur lo vinco d'amor che fa natura,onde nel cerchio secondo s'annida
non ti rimembra di quelle parole,con le quai la tua etica pertratta,le tre disposizion che 'l ciel non vole
dal divino 'ntelletto e da sua arte,e se tu ben la tua fisica note,tu troverai non dopo molte carte
era lo loco ov' a scender la riva,venimmo alpestro e per quel che v'er' anco,tal ch'ogne vista ne sarebbe schiva
io vidi un'ampia fossa in arco torta,come quella che tutto 'l piano abbraccia,secondo ch'avea detto la mia scorta
veggendoci calar ciascun ristette,e de la schiera tre si dipartiro,con archi e asticciuole prima elette
or ci movemmo con la scorta fida,lungo la proda del bollor vermiglio,dove i bolliti facieno alte strida
poi vidi gente che di fuor del rio,tenean la testa e ancor tutto 'l casso,e di costoro assai riconobb' io
la divina giustizia di qua punge,quell' attila che fu flagello in terra,e pirro e sesto e in etterno munge
le lagrime che col bollor diserra,a rinier da corneto a rinier pazzo,che fecero a le strade tanta guerra
quivi le brutte arpie lor nidi fanno,che cacciar de le strofade i troiani,con tristo annunzio di futuro danno
io sentia d'ogne parte trarre guai,e non vedea persona che 'l facesse,per ch'io tutto smarrito m'arrestai
come d'un stizzo verde ch'arso sia,da l'un de' capi che da l'altro geme,e cigola per vento che va via
non averebbe in te la man distesa,ma la cosa incredibile mi fece,indurlo ad ovra ch'a me stesso pesa
la meretrice che mai da l'ospizio,di cesare non torse li occhi putti,morte comune e de le corti vizio
l'animo mio per disdegnoso gusto,credendo col morir fuggir disdegno,ingiusto fece me contra me giusto
e se di voi alcun nel mondo riede,conforti la memoria mia che giace,ancor del colpo che 'nvidia le diede
di dirne come l'anima si lega,in questi nocchi e dinne se tu puoi,s'alcuna mai di tai membra si spiega
surge in vermena e in pianta silvestra,l'arpie pascendo poi de le sue foglie,fanno dolore e al dolor fenestra
qui le strascineremo e per la mesta,selva saranno i nostri corpi appesi,ciascuno al prun de l'ombra sua molesta
noi eravamo ancora al tronco attesi,credendo ch'altro ne volesse dire,quando noi fummo d'un romor sorpresi
similemente a colui che venire,sente 'l porco e la caccia a la sua posta,ch'ode le bestie e le frasche stormire
di rietro a loro era la selva piena,di nere cagne bramose e correnti,come veltri ch'uscisser di catena
presemi allor la mia scorta per mano,e menommi al cespuglio che piangea,per le rotture sanguinenti in vano
que' cittadin che poi la rifondarno,sovra 'l cener che d'attila rimase,avrebber fatto lavorare indarno
indi venimmo al fine ove si parte,lo secondo giron dal terzo e dove,si vede di giustizia orribil arte
a ben manifestar le cose nove,dico che arrivammo ad una landa,che dal suo letto ogne pianta rimove
d'anime nude vidi molte gregge,che piangean tutte assai miseramente,e parea posta lor diversa legge
sovra tutto 'l sabbion d'un cader lento,piovean di foco dilatate falde,come di neve in alpe sanza vento
tale scendeva l'etternale ardore,onde la rena s'accendea com' esca,sotto focile a doppiar lo dolore
o s'elli stanchi li altri a muta a muta,in mongibello a la focina negra,chiamando buon vulcano aiuta aiuta
dio in disdegno e poco par che 'l pregi,ma com' io dissi lui li suoi dispetti,sono al suo petto assai debiti fregi
or mi vien dietro e guarda che non metti,ancor li piedi ne la rena arsiccia,ma sempre al bosco tien li piedi stretti
lo fondo suo e ambo le pendici,fatt' era 'n pietra e ' margini dallato,per ch'io m'accorsi che 'l passo era lici
e quali padoan lungo la brenta,per difender lor ville e lor castelli,anzi che carentana il caldo senta
quando incontrammo d'anime una schiera,che venian lungo l'argine e ciascuna,ci riguardava come suol da sera
io non osava scender de la strada,per andar par di lui ma 'l capo chino,tenea com' uom che reverente vada
ma quello ingrato popolo maligno,che discese di fiesole ab antico,e tiene ancor del monte e del macigno
la tua fortuna tanto onor ti serba,che l'una parte e l'altra avranno fame,di te ma lungi fia dal becco l'erba
faccian le bestie fiesolane strame,di lor medesme e non tocchin la pianta,s'alcuna surge ancora in lor letame
in cui riviva la sementa santa,di que' roman che vi rimaser quando,fu fatto il nido di malizia tanta
m'insegnavate come l'uom s'etterna,e quant' io l'abbia in grado mentr' io vivo,convien che ne la mia lingua si scerna
in somma sappi che tutti fur cherci,e litterati grandi e di gran fama,d'un peccato medesmo al mondo lerci
priscian sen va con quella turba grama,e francesco d'accorso anche e vedervi,s'avessi avuto di tal tigna brama
poi si rivolse e parve di coloro,che corrono a verona il drappo verde,per la campagna e parve di costoro
quando tre ombre insieme si partiro,correndo d'una torma che passava,sotto la pioggia de l'aspro martiro
e se non fosse il foco che saetta,la natura del loco i' dicerei,che meglio stesse a te che a lor la fretta
qual sogliono i campion far nudi e unti,avvisando lor presa e lor vantaggio,prima che sien tra lor battuti e punti
questi l'orme di cui pestar mi vedi,tutto che nudo e dipelato vada,fu di grado maggior che tu non credi
nepote fu de la buona gualdrada,guido guerra ebbe nome e in sua vita,fece col senno assai e con la spada
s'i' fossi stato dal foco coperto,gittato mi sarei tra lor di sotto,e credo che 'l dottor l'avria sofferto
ma perch' io mi sarei brusciato e cotto,vinse paura la mia buona voglia,che di loro abbracciar mi facea ghiotto
tosto che questo mio segnor mi disse,parole per le quali i' mi pensai,che qual voi siete tal gente venisse
di vostra terra sono e sempre mai,l'ovra di voi e li onorati nomi,con affezion ritrassi e ascoltai
lascio lo fele e vo per dolci pomi,promessi a me per lo verace duca,ma 'nfino al centro pria convien ch'i' tomi
fa che di noi a la gente favelle,indi rupper la rota e a fuggirsi,ali sembiar le gambe loro isnelle
come quel fiume c'ha proprio cammino,prima dal monte viso 'nver' levante,da la sinistra costa d'apennino
io avea una corda intorno cinta,e con essa pensai alcuna volta,prender la lonza a la pelle dipinta
ahi quanto cauti li uomini esser dienno,presso a color che non veggion pur l'ovra,ma per entro i pensier miran col senno
ch'i' vidi per quell' aere grosso e scuro,venir notando una figura in suso,maravigliosa ad ogne cor sicuro
la faccia sua era faccia d'uom giusto,tanto benigna avea di fuor la pelle,e d'un serpente tutto l'altro fusto
due branche avea pilose insin l'ascelle,lo dosso e 'l petto e ambedue le coste,dipinti avea di nodi e di rotelle
poi che nel viso a certi li occhi porsi,ne' quali 'l doloroso foco casca,non ne conobbi alcun ma io m'accorsi
che dal collo a ciascun pendea una tasca,ch'avea certo colore e certo segno,e quindi par che 'l loro occhio si pasca
e com' io riguardando tra lor vegno,in una borsa gialla vidi azzurro,che d'un leone avea faccia e contegno
ma esso ch'altra volta mi sovvenne,ad altro forse tosto ch'i' montai,con le braccia m'avvinse e mi sostenne
che fu la mia quando vidi ch'i' era,ne l'aere d'ogne parte e vidi spenta,ogne veduta fuor che de la fera
ella sen va notando lenta lenta,rota e discende ma non me n'accorgo,se non che al viso e di sotto mi venta
discende lasso onde si move isnello,per cento rote e da lunge si pone,dal suo maestro disdegnoso e fello
tale imagine quivi facean quelli,e come a tai fortezze da' lor sogli,a la ripa di fuor son ponticelli
a la man destra vidi nova pieta,novo tormento e novi frustatori,di che la prima bolgia era repleta
come i roman per l'essercito molto,l'anno del giubileo su per lo ponte,hanno a passar la gente modo colto
che da l'un lato tutti hanno la fronte,verso 'l castello e vanno a santo pietro,da l'altra sponda vanno verso 'l monte
i' fui colui che la ghisolabella,condussi a far la voglia del marchese,come che suoni la sconcia novella
lasciolla quivi gravida soletta,tal colpa a tal martiro lui condanna,e anche di medea si fa vendetta
al drudo suo quando disse ho io grazie,grandi apo te,: anzi maravigliose
o simon mago o miseri seguaci,che le cose di dio che di bontate,deon essere spose e voi rapaci
fuor de la bocca a ciascun soperchiava,d'un peccator li piedi e de le gambe,infino al grosso e l'altro dentro stava
di sotto al capo mio son li altri tratti,che precedetter me simoneggiando,per le fessure de la pietra piatti
e se non fosse ch'ancor lo mi vieta,la reverenza de le somme chiavi,che tu tenesti ne la vita lieta
di voi pastor s'accorse il vangelista,quando colei che siede sopra l'acque,puttaneggiar coi regi a lui fu vista
quella che con le sette teste nacque,e da le diece corna ebbe argomento,fin che virtute al suo marito piacque
ahi costantin di quanto mal fu matre,non la tua conversion ma quella dote,che da te prese il primo ricco patre
quivi soavemente spuose il carco,soave per lo scoglio sconcio ed erto,che sarebbe a le capre duro varco
e vidi gente per lo vallon tondo,venir tacendo e lagrimando al passo,che fanno le letane in questo mondo
se dio ti lasci lettor prender frutto,di tua lezione or pensa per te stesso,com' io potea tener lo viso asciutto
drizza la testa drizza e vedi a cui,s'aperse a li occhi d'i teban la terra,per ch'ei gridavan tutti: dove rui
ebbe tra ' bianchi marmi la spelonca,per sua dimora onde a guardar le stelle,e 'l mar non li era la veduta tronca
non molto ha corso ch'el trova una lama,ne la qual si distende e la 'mpaluda,e suol di state talor essere grama
quindi passando la vergine cruda,vide terra nel mezzo del pantano,sanza coltura e d'abitanti nuda
li uomini poi che 'ntorno erano sparti,s'accolsero a quel loco ch'era forte,per lo pantan ch'avea da tutte parti
vedi guido bonatti vedi asdente,ch'avere inteso al cuoio e a lo spago,ora vorrebbe ma tardi si pente
vedi le triste che lasciaron l'ago,la spuola e 'l fuso e fecersi 'ndivine,fecer malie con erbe e con imago
restammo per veder l'altra fessura,di malebolge e li altri pianti vani,e vidila mirabilmente oscura
chi ribatte da proda e chi da poppa,altri fa remi e altri volge sarte,chi terzeruolo e artimon rintoppa
che per veder non indugia 'l partire,e vidi dietro a noi un diavol nero,correndo su per lo scoglio venire
e per nulla offension che mi sia fatta,non temer tu ch'i' ho le cose conte,perch' altra volta fui a tal baratta
innanzi che l'uncin vostro mi pigli,traggasi avante l'un di voi che m'oda,e poi d'arruncigliarmi si consigli
i' m'accostai con tutta la persona,lungo 'l mio duca e non torceva li occhi,da la sembianza lor ch'era non buona
cercate 'ntorno le boglienti pane,costor sian salvi infino a l'altro scheggio,che tutto intero va sovra le tane
per l'argine sinistro volta dienno,ma prima avea ciascun la lingua stretta,coi denti verso lor duca per cenno
corridor vidi per la terra vostra,o aretini e vidi gir gualdane,fedir torneamenti e correr giostra
quando con trombe e quando con campane,con tamburi e con cenni di castella,e con cose nostrali e con istrane
pur a la pegola era la mia 'ntesa,per veder de la bolgia ogne contegno,e de la gente ch'entro v'era incesa
come i dalfini quando fanno segno,a' marinar con l'arco de la schiena,che s'argomentin di campar lor legno
poi fui famiglia del buon re tebaldo,quivi mi misi a far baratteria,di ch'io rendo ragione in questo caldo
draghignazzo anco i volle dar di piglio,giuso a le gambe onde 'l decurio loro,si volse intorno intorno con mal piglio
usa con esso donno michel zanche,di logodoro e a dir di sardigna,le lingue lor non si sentono stanche
irato calcabrina de la buffa,volando dietro li tenne invaghito,che quei campasse per aver la zuffa
ma l'altro fu bene sparvier grifagno,ad artigliar ben lui e amendue,cadder nel mezzo del bogliente stagno
taciti soli sanza compagnia,n'andavam l'un dinanzi e l'altro dopo,come frati minor vanno per via
come 'l maestro mio per quel vivagno,portandosene me sovra 'l suo petto,come suo figlio non come compagno
oh in etterno faticoso manto,noi ci volgemmo ancor pur a man manca,con loro insieme intenti al tristo pianto
ristetti e vidi due mostrar gran fretta,de l'animo col viso d'esser meco,ma tardavali 'l carco e la via stretta
frati godenti fummo e bolognesi,io catalano e questi loderingo,nomati e da tua terra insieme presi
come suole esser tolto un uom solingo,per conservar sua pace e fummo tali,ch'ancor si pare intorno dal gardingo
e a tal modo il socero si stenta,in questa fossa e li altri dal concilio,che fu per li giudei mala sementa
allor vid' io maravigliar virgilio,sovra colui ch'era disteso in croce,tanto vilmente ne l'etterno essilio
onde noi amendue possiamo uscirci,sanza costrigner de li angeli neri,che vegnan d'esto fondo a dipartirci
appresso il duca a gran passi sen gi,turbato un poco d'ira nel sembiante,ond' io da li 'ncarcati mi parti
quando la brina in su la terra assempra,l'imagine di sua sorella bianca,ma poco dura a la sua penna tempra
lo villanello a cui la roba manca,si leva e guarda e vede la campagna,biancheggiar tutta ond' ei si batte l'anca
veggendo 'l mondo aver cangiata faccia,in poco d'ora e prende suo vincastro,e fuor le pecorelle a pascer caccia
le braccia aperse dopo alcun consiglio,eletto seco riguardando prima,ben la ruina e diedemi di piglio
che l'una costa surge e l'altra scende,noi pur venimmo al fine in su la punta,onde l'ultima pietra si scoscende
noi discendemmo il ponte da la testa,dove s'aggiugne con l'ottava ripa,e poi mi fu la bolgia manifesta
con serpi le man dietro avean legate,quelle ficcavan per le ren la coda,e 'l capo ed eran dinanzi aggroppate
quando si leva che 'ntorno si mira,tutto smarrito de la grande angoscia,ch'elli ha sofferta e guardando sospira
apri li orecchi al mio annunzio e odi,pistoia in pria d'i neri si dimagra,poi fiorenza rinova gente e modi
maremma non cred' io che tante n'abbia,quante bisce elli avea su per la groppa,infin ove comincia nostra labbia
sovra le spalle dietro da la coppa,con l'ali aperte li giacea un draco,e quello affuoca qualunque s'intoppa
non va co' suoi fratei per un cammino,per lo furto che frodolente fece,del grande armento ch'elli ebbe a vicino
io non li conoscea ma ei seguette,come suol seguitar per alcun caso,che l'un nomar un altro convenette
fersi le braccia due di quattro liste,le cosce con le gambe e 'l ventre e 'l casso,divenner membra che non fuor mai viste
ogne primaio aspetto ivi era casso,due e nessun l'imagine perversa,parea e tal sen gio con lento passo
elli 'l serpente e quei lui riguardava,l'un per la piaga e l'altro per la bocca,fummavan forte e 'l fummo si scontrava
insieme si rispuosero a tai norme,che 'l serpente la coda in forca fesse,e 'l feruto ristrinse insieme l'orme
mentre che 'l fummo l'uno e l'altro vela,di color novo e genera 'l pel suso,per l'una parte e da l'altra il dipela
l'anima ch'era fiera divenuta,suffolando si fugge per la valle,e l'altro dietro a lui parlando sputa
e avvegna che li occhi miei confusi,fossero alquanto e l'animo smagato,non poter quei fuggirsi tanto chiusi
ch'i' non scorgessi ben puccio sciancato,ed era quel che sol di tre compagni,che venner prima non era mutato
tra li ladron trovai cinque cotali,tuoi cittadini onde mi ven vergogna,e tu in grande orranza non ne sali
ma se presso al mattin del ver si sogna,tu sentirai di qua da picciol tempo,di quel che prato non ch'altri t'agogna
quante 'l villan ch'al poggio si riposa,nel tempo che colui che 'l mondo schiara,la faccia sua a noi tien meno ascosa
che non mi facci de l'attender niego,fin che la fiamma cornuta qua vegna,vedi che del disio ver' lei mi piego
poi che la fiamma fu venuta quivi,dove parve al mio duca tempo e loco,in questa forma lui parlare audivi
quando nel mondo li alti versi scrissi,non vi movete ma l'un di voi dica,dove per lui perduto a morir gissi
vincer potero dentro a me l'ardore,ch'i' ebbi a divenir del mondo esperto,e de li vizi umani e del valore
ma misi me per l'alto mare aperto,sol con un legno e con quella compagna,picciola da la qual non fui diserto
l'un lito e l'altro vidi infin la spagna,fin nel morrocco e l'isola d'i sardi,e l'altre che quel mare intorno bagna
o frati dissi che per cento milia,perigli siete giunti a l'occidente,a questa tanto picciola vigilia
considerate la vostra semenza,fatti non foste a viver come bruti,ma per seguir virtute e canoscenza
e volta nostra poppa nel mattino,de' remi facemmo ali al folle volo,sempre acquistando dal lato mancino
cinque volte racceso e tante casso,lo lume era di sotto da la luna,poi che 'ntrati eravam ne l'alto passo
perch' io sia giunto forse alquanto tardo,non t'incresca restare a parlar meco,vedi che non incresce a me e ardo
se tu pur mo in questo mondo cieco,caduto se' di quella dolce terra,latina ond' io mia colpa tutta reco
se non fosse il gran prete a cui mal prenda,che mi rimise ne le prime colpe,e come e quare voglio che m'intenda
quando mi vidi giunto in quella parte,di mia etade ove ciascun dovrebbe,calar le vele e raccoglier le sarte
e pentuto e confesso mi rendei,ahi miser lasso,e giovato sarebbe
francesco venne poi com' io fu' morto,per me ma un d'i neri cherubini,li disse: non portar: non mi far torto
oh me dolente,come mi riscossi,quando mi prese dicendomi: forse
noi passamm' oltre e io e 'l duca mio,su per lo scoglio infino in su l'altr' arco,che cuopre 'l fosso in che si paga il fio
ogne lingua per certo verria meno,per lo nostro sermone e per la mente,c'hanno a tanto comprender poco seno
con quella che sentio di colpi doglie,per contastare a ruberto guiscardo,e l'altra il cui ossame ancor s'accoglie
e qual forato suo membro e qual mozzo,mostrasse d'aequar sarebbe nulla,il modo de la nona bolgia sozzo
tra le gambe pendevan le minugia,la corata pareva e 'l tristo sacco,che merda fa di quel che si trangugia
un altro che forata avea la gola,e tronco 'l naso infin sotto le ciglia,e non avea mai ch'una orecchia sola
gittati saran fuor di lor vasello,e mazzerati presso a la cattolica,per tradimento d'un tiranno fello
quel traditor che vede pur con l'uno,e tien la terra che tale qui meco,vorrebbe di vedere esser digiuno
questi scacciato il dubitar sommerse,in cesare affermando che 'l fornito,sempre con danno l'attender sofferse
che disse lasso,capo ha cosa fatta,che fu mal seme per la gente tosca
qual dolor fora se de li spedali,di valdichiana tra 'l luglio e 'l settembre,e di maremma e di sardigna i mali
fossero in una fossa tutti 'nsembre,tal era quivi e tal puzzo n'usciva,qual suol venir de le marcite membre
che li animali infino al picciol vermo,cascaron tutti e poi le genti antiche,secondo che i poeti hanno per fermo
si ristorar di seme di formiche,ch'era a veder per quella oscura valle,languir li spirti per diverse biche
qual sovra 'l ventre e qual sovra le spalle,l'un de l'altro giacea e qual carpone,si trasmutava per lo tristo calle
passo passo andavam sanza sermone,guardando e ascoltando li ammalati,che non potean levar le lor persone
allor si ruppe lo comun rincalzo,e tremando ciascuno a me si volse,con altri che l'udiron di rimbalzo
ditemi chi voi siete e di che genti,la vostra sconcia e fastidiosa pena,di palesarvi a me non vi spaventi
volle ch'i' li mostrassi l'arte e solo,perch' io nol feci dedalo mi fece,ardere a tal che l'avea per figliuolo
e tra'ne la brigata in che disperse,caccia d'ascian la vigna e la gran fonda,e l'abbagliato suo senno proferse
atamante divenne tanto insano,che veggendo la moglie con due figli,andar carcata da ciascuna mano
ecuba trista misera e cattiva,poscia che vide polissena morta,e del suo polidoro in su la riva
quant' io vidi in due ombre smorte e nude,che mordendo correvan di quel modo,che 'l porco quando del porcil si schiude
e poi che i due rabbiosi fuor passati,sovra cu' io avea l'occhio tenuto,rivolsilo a guardar li altri mal nati
li ruscelletti che d'i verdi colli,del casentin discendon giuso in arno,faccendo i lor canali freddi e molli
ma s'io vedessi qui l'anima trista,di guido o d'alessandro o di lor frate,per fonte branda non darei la vista
cercando lui tra questa gente sconcia,con tutto ch'ella volge undici miglia,e men d'un mezzo di traverso non ci ha
tu hai l'arsura e 'l capo che ti duole,e per leccar lo specchio di narcisso,non vorresti a 'nvitar molte parole
quand' io 'l senti' a me parlar con ira,volsimi verso lui con tal vergogna,ch'ancor per la memoria mi si gira
noi demmo il dosso al misero vallone,su per la ripa che 'l cinge dintorno,attraversando sanza alcun sermone
sappi che non son torri ma giganti,e son nel pozzo intorno da la ripa,da l'umbilico in giuso tutti quanti
torreggiavan di mezza la persona,li orribili giganti cui minaccia,giove del cielo ancora quando tuona
la faccia sua mi parea lunga e grossa,come la pina di san pietro a roma,e a sua proporzione eran l'altre ossa
a cigner lui qual che fosse 'l maestro,non so io dir ma el tenea soccinto,dinanzi l'altro e dietro il braccio destro
per ch'io mi volsi e vidimi davante,e sotto i piedi un lago che per gelo,avea di vetro e non d'acqua sembiante
e come a gracidar si sta la rana,col muso fuor de l'acqua quando sogna,di spigolar sovente la villana
li occhi lor ch'eran pria pur dentro molli,gocciar su per le labbra e 'l gelo strinse,le lagrime tra essi e riserrolli
se vuoi saper chi son cotesti due,la valle onde bisenzo si dichina,del padre loro alberto e di lor fue
non quelli a cui fu rotto il petto e l'ombra,con esso un colpo per la man d'artu,non focaccia non questi che m'ingombra
e mentre ch'andavamo inver' lo mezzo,al quale ogne gravezza si rauna,e io tremava ne l'etterno rezzo
non ti basta sonar con le mascelle,se tu non latri,qual diavol ti tocca
che se tu a ragion di lui ti piangi,sappiendo chi voi siete e la sua pecca,nel mondo suso ancora io te ne cangi
ma se le mie parole esser dien seme,che frutti infamia al traditor ch'i' rodo,parlar e lagrimar vedrai insieme
breve pertugio dentro da la muda,la qual per me ha 'l titol de la fame,e che conviene ancor ch'altrui si chiuda
questi pareva a me maestro e donno,cacciando il lupo e ' lupicini al monte,per che i pisan veder lucca non ponno
in picciol corso mi parieno stanchi,lo padre e ' figli e con l'agute scane,mi parea lor veder fender li fianchi
quando fui desto innanzi la dimane,pianger senti' fra 'l sonno i miei figliuoli,ch'eran con meco e dimandar del pane
e io senti' chiavar l'uscio di sotto,a l'orribile torre ond' io guardai,nel viso a' mie' figliuoi sanza far motto
come un poco di raggio si fu messo,nel doloroso carcere e io scorsi,per quattro visi il mio aspetto stesso
e disser: padre assai ci fia men doglia,se tu mangi di noi: tu ne vestisti,queste misere carni e tu le spoglia
che se 'l conte ugolino aveva voce,d'aver tradita te de le castella,non dovei tu i figliuoi porre a tal croce
come quando una grossa nebbia spira,o quando l'emisperio nostro annotta,par di lungi un molin che 'l vento gira
quando noi fummo fatti tanto avante,ch'al mio maestro piacque di mostrarmi,la creatura ch'ebbe il bel sembiante
io non mori' e non rimasi vivo,pensa oggimai per te s'hai fior d'ingegno,qual io divenni d'uno e d'altro privo
oh quanto parve a me gran maraviglia,quand' io vidi tre facce a la sua testa,l'una dinanzi e quella era vermiglia
sotto ciascuna uscivan due grand' ali,quanto si convenia a tanto uccello,vele di mar non vid' io mai cotali
a quel dinanzi il mordere era nulla,verso 'l graffiar che talvolta la schiena,rimanea de la pelle tutta brulla
com' a lui piacque il collo li avvinghiai,ed el prese di tempo e loco poste,e quando l'ali fuoro aperte assai
d'un ruscelletto che quivi discende,per la buca d'un sasso ch'elli ha roso,col corso ch'elli avvolge e poco pende
lo duca e io per quel cammino ascoso,intrammo a ritornar nel chiaro mondo,e sanza cura aver d'alcun riposo
seguitando il mio canto con quel suono,di cui le piche misere sentiro,lo colpo tal che disperar perdono
i' mi volsi a man destra e puosi mente,a l'altro polo e vidi quattro stelle,non viste mai fuor ch'a la prima gente
lunga la barba e di pel bianco mista,portava a' suoi capelli simigliante,de' quai cadeva al petto doppia lista
di marzia tua che 'n vista ancor ti priega,o santo petto che per tua la tegni,per lo suo amore adunque a noi ti piega
noi andavam per lo solingo piano,com' om che torna a la perduta strada,che 'nfino ad essa li pare ire in vano
ambo le mani in su l'erbetta sparte,soavemente 'l mio maestro pose,ond' io che fui accorto di sua arte
porsi ver' lui le guance lagrimose,ivi mi fece tutto discoverto,quel color che l'inferno mi nascose
venimmo poi in sul lito diserto,che mai non vide navicar sue acque,omo che di tornar sia poscia esperto
e la notte che opposita a lui cerchia,uscia di gange fuor con le bilance,che le caggion di man quando soverchia
noi eravam lunghesso mare ancora,come gente che pensa a suo cammino,che va col cuore e col corpo dimora
lo mio maestro ancor non facea motto,mentre che i primi bianchi apparver ali,allor che ben conobbe il galeotto
vedi come l'ha dritte verso 'l cielo,trattando l'aere con l'etterne penne,che non si mutan come mortal pelo
ma chinail giuso e quei sen venne a riva,con un vasello snelletto e leggero,tanto che l'acqua nulla ne 'nghiottiva
da tutte parti saettava il giorno,lo sol ch'avea con le saette conte,di mezzo 'l ciel cacciato capricorno
l'anime che si fuor di me accorte,per lo spirare ch'i' era ancor vivo,maravigliando diventaro smorte
e come a messagger che porta ulivo,tragge la gente per udir novelle,e di calcar nessun si mostra schivo
ohi ombre vane fuor che ne l'aspetto,tre volte dietro a lei le mani avvinsi,e tante mi tornai con esse al petto
di maraviglia credo mi dipinsi,per che l'ombra sorrise e si ritrasse,e io seguendo lei oltre mi pinsi
soavemente disse ch'io posasse,allor conobbi chi era e pregai,che per parlarmi un poco s'arrestasse
come quando cogliendo biado o loglio,li colombi adunati a la pastura,queti sanza mostrar l'usato orgoglio
se cosa appare ond' elli abbian paura,subitamente lasciano star l'esca,perch' assaliti son da maggior cura
avvegna che la subitana fuga,dispergesse color per la campagna,rivolti al monte ove ragion ne fruga
i' mi ristrinsi a la fida compagna,e come sare' io sanza lui corso,chi m'avria tratto su per la montagna
quando li piedi suoi lasciar la fretta,che l'onestade ad ogn' atto dismaga,la mente mia che prima era ristretta
io mi volsi dallato con paura,d'essere abbandonato quand' io vidi,solo dinanzi a me la terra oscura
e mentre ch'e' tenendo 'l viso basso,essaminava del cammin la mente,e io mirava suso intorno al sasso
ancora era quel popol di lontano,i' dico dopo i nostri mille passi,quanto un buon gittator trarria con mano
quando si strinser tutti ai duri massi,de l'alta ripa e stetter fermi e stretti,com' a guardar chi va dubbiando stassi
come le pecorelle escon del chiuso,a una a due a tre e l'altre stanno,timidette atterrando l'occhio e 'l muso
io mi volsi ver' lui e guardail fiso,biondo era e bello e di gentile aspetto,ma l'un de' cigli un colpo avea diviso
vadi a mia bella figlia genitrice,de l'onor di cicilia e d'aragona,e dichi 'l vero a lei s'altro si dice
poscia ch'io ebbi rotta la persona,di due punte mortali io mi rendei,piangendo a quei che volontier perdona
se 'l pastor di cosenza che a la caccia,di me fu messo per clemente allora,avesse in dio ben letta questa faccia
l'ossa del corpo mio sarieno ancora,in co del ponte presso a benevento,sotto la guardia de la grave mora
vedi oggimai se tu mi puoi far lieto,revelando a la mia buona costanza,come m'hai visto e anco esto divieto
maggiore aperta molte volte impruna,con una forcatella di sue spine,l'uom de la villa quando l'uva imbruna
dico con l'ale snelle e con le piume,del gran disio di retro a quel condotto,che speranza mi dava e facea lume
noi salavam per entro 'l sasso rotto,e d'ogne lato ne stringea lo stremo,e piedi e man volea il suol di sotto
li occhi prima drizzai ai bassi liti,poscia li alzai al sole e ammirava,che da sinistra n'eravam feriti
vedrai come a costui convien che vada,da l'un quando a colui da l'altro fianco,se lo 'ntelletto tuo ben chiaro bada
che 'l mezzo cerchio del moto superno,che si chiama equatore in alcun' arte,e che sempre riman tra 'l sole e 'l verno
quiritto se,attendi tu iscorta,o pur lo modo usato t'ha' ripriso
prima convien che tanto il ciel m'aggiri,di fuor da essa quanto fece in vita,per ch'io 'ndugiai al fine i buon sospiri
li occhi rivolsi al suon di questo motto,e vidile guardar per maraviglia,pur me pur me e 'l lume ch'era rotto
ond' io che solo innanzi a li altri parlo,ti priego se mai vedi quel paese,che siede tra romagna e quel di carlo
io fui di montefeltro io son bonconte,giovanna o altri non ha di me cura,per ch'io vo tra costor con bassa fronte
quivi perdei la vista e la parola,nel nome di maria fini' e quivi,caddi e rimase la mia carne sola
ben sai come ne l'aere si raccoglie,quell' umido vapor che in acqua riede,tosto che sale dove 'l freddo il coglie
quando si parte il gioco de la zara,colui che perde si riman dolente,repetendo le volte e tristo impara
con l'altro se ne va tutta la gente,qual va dinanzi e qual di dietro il prende,e qual dallato li si reca a mente
vidi conte orso e l'anima divisa,dal corpo suo per astio e per inveggia,com' e' dicea non per colpa commisa
non so se 'ntendi: io dico di beatrice,tu la vedrai di sopra in su la vetta,di questo monte ridere e felice
venimmo a lei: o anima lombarda,come ti stavi altera e disdegnosa,e nel mover de li occhi onesta e tarda
pur virgilio si trasse a lei pregando,che ne mostrasse la miglior salita,e quella non rispuose al suo dimando
ahi serva italia di dolore ostello,nave sanza nocchiere in gran tempesta,non donna di province ma bordello
e ora in te non stanno sanza guerra,li vivi tuoi e l'un l'altro si rode,di quei ch'un muro e una fossa serra
cerca misera intorno da le prode,le tue marine e poi ti guarda in seno,s'alcuna parte in te di pace gode
giusto giudicio da le stelle caggia,sovra 'l tuo sangue e sia novo e aperto,tal che 'l tuo successor temenza n'aggia
molti han giustizia in cuore e tardi scocca,per non venir sanza consiglio a l'arco,ma il popol tuo l'ha in sommo de la bocca
verso di te che fai tanto sottili,provedimenti ch'a mezzo novembre,non giugne quel che tu d'ottobre fili
quante volte del tempo che rimembre,legge moneta officio e costume,hai tu mutato e rinovate membre
qual merito o qual grazia mi ti mostra,s'io son d'udir le tue parole degno,dimmi se vien d'inferno e di qual chiostra
non per far ma per non fare ho perduto,a veder l'alto sol che tu disiri,e che fu tardi per me conosciuto
quivi sto io coi pargoli innocenti,dai denti morsi de la morte avante,che fosser da l'umana colpa essenti
poco allungati c'eravam di lici,quand' io m'accorsi che 'l monte era scemo,a guisa che i vallon li sceman quici
oro e argento fine cocco e biacca,indaco legno lucido e sereno,fresco smeraldo in l'ora che si fiacca
l'altro che ne la vista lui conforta,resse la terra dove l'acqua nasce,che molta in albia e albia in mar ne porta
ottacchero ebbe nome e ne le fasce,fu meglio assai che vincislao suo figlio,barbuto cui lussuria e ozio pasce
e se re dopo lui fosse rimaso,lo giovanetto che retro a lui siede,ben andava il valor di vaso in vaso
che non si puote dir de l'altre rede,iacomo e federigo hanno i reami,del retaggio miglior nessun possiede
e che lo novo peregrin d'amore,punge se ode squilla di lontano,che paia il giorno pianger che si more
quand' io incominciai a render vano,l'udire e a mirare una de l'alme,surta che l'ascoltar chiedea con mano
e l'altre poi dolcemente e devote,seguitar lei per tutto l'inno intero,avendo li occhi a le superne rote
verdi come fogliette pur mo nate,erano in veste che da verdi penne,percosse traean dietro e ventilate
ond' io che non sapeva per qual calle,mi volsi intorno e stretto m'accostai,tutto gelato a le fidate spalle
solo tre passi credo ch'i' scendesse,e fui di sotto e vidi un che mirava,pur me come conoscer mi volesse
ver' me si fece e io ver' lui mi fei,giudice nin gentil quanto mi piacque,quando ti vidi non esser tra ' rei
per lei assai di lieve si comprende,quanto in femmina foco d'amor dura,se l'occhio o 'l tatto spesso non l'accende
da quella parte onde non ha riparo,la picciola vallea era una biscia,forse qual diede ad eva il cibo amaro
fui chiamato currado malaspina,non son l'antico ma di lui discesi,a' miei portai l'amor che qui raffina
e io vi giuro s'io di sopra vada,che vostra gente onrata non si sfregia,del pregio de la borsa e de la spada
di gemme la sua fronte era lucente,poste in figura del freddo animale,che con la coda percuote la gente
ne l'ora che comincia i tristi lai,la rondinella presso a la mattina,forse a memoria de' suo' primi guai
in sogno mi parea veder sospesa,un'aguglia nel ciel con penne d'oro,con l'ali aperte e a calare intesa
poi mi parea che poi rotata un poco,terribil come folgor discendesse,e me rapisse suso infino al foco
mi cambia' io e come sanza cura,vide me 'l duca mio su per lo balzo,si mosse e io di rietro inver' l'altura
vidi una porta e tre gradi di sotto,per gire ad essa di color diversi,e un portier ch'ancor non facea motto
divoto mi gittai a' santi piedi,misericordia chiesi e ch'el m'aprisse,ma tre volte nel petto pria mi diedi
cenere o terra che secca si cavi,d'un color fora col suo vestimento,e di sotto da quel trasse due chiavi
da pier le tegno e dissemi ch'i' erri,anzi ad aprir ch'a tenerla serrata,pur che la gente a' piedi mi s'atterri
e quando fuor ne' cardini distorti,li spigoli di quella regge sacra,che di metallo son sonanti e forti
e questo fece i nostri passi scarsi,tanto che pria lo scemo de la luna,rigiunse al letto suo per ricorcarsi
e quanto l'occhio mio potea trar d'ale,or dal sinistro e or dal destro fianco,questa cornice mi parea cotale
l'angel che venne in terra col decreto,de la molt' anni lagrimata pace,ch'aperse il ciel del suo lungo divieto
per ch'i' mi mossi col viso e vedea,di retro da maria da quella costa,onde m'era colui che mi movea
i' dico di traiano imperadore,e una vedovella li era al freno,di lagrime atteggiata e di dolore
intorno a lui parea calcato e pieno,di cavalieri e l'aguglie ne l'oro,sovr' essi in vista al vento si movieno
mentr' io mi dilettava di guardare,l'imagini di tante umilitadi,e per lo fabbro loro a veder care
li occhi miei ch'a mirare eran contenti,per veder novitadi ond' e' son vaghi,volgendosi ver' lui non furon lenti
o superbi cristian miseri lassi,che de la vista de la mente infermi,fidanza avete ne' retrosi passi
non v'accorgete voi che noi siam vermi,nati a formar l'angelica farfalla,che vola a la giustizia sanza schermi
come per sostentar solaio o tetto,per mensola talvolta una figura,si vede giugner le ginocchia al petto
e come noi lo mal ch'avem sofferto,perdoniamo a ciascuno e tu perdona,benigno e non guardar lo nostro merto
disparmente angosciate tutte a tondo,e lasse su per la prima cornice,purgando la caligine del mondo
le lor parole che rendero a queste,che dette avea colui cu' io seguiva,non fur da cui venisser manifeste
e s'io non fossi impedito dal sasso,che la cervice mia superba doma,onde portar convienmi il viso basso
cotesti ch'ancor vive e non si noma,guardere' io per veder s'i' 'l conosco,e per farlo pietoso a questa soma
ogn' uomo ebbi in despetto tanto avante,ch'io ne mori' come i sanesi sanno,e sallo in campagnatico ogne fante
e qui convien ch'io questo peso porti,per lei tanto che a dio si sodisfaccia,poi ch'io nol fe' tra ' vivi qui tra ' morti
e videmi e conobbemi e chiamava,tenendo li occhi con fatica fisi,a me che tutto chin con loro andava
di tal superbia qui si paga il fio,e ancor non sarei qui se non fosse,che possendo peccar mi volsi a dio
di pari come buoi che vanno a giogo,m'andava io con quell' anima carca,fin che 'l sofferse il dolce pedagogo
vedea timbreo vedea pallade e marte,armati ancora intorno al padre loro,mirar le membra d'i giganti sparte
mostrava come in rotta si fuggiro,li assiri poi che fu morto oloferne,e anche le reliquie del martiro
qual di pennel fu maestro o di stile,che ritraesse l'ombre e ' tratti ch'ivi,mirar farieno uno ingegno sottile
morti li morti e i vivi parean vivi,non vide mei di me chi vide il vero,quant' io calcai fin che chinato givi
come a man destra per salire al monte,dove siede la chiesa che soggioga,la ben guidata sopra rubaconte
si rompe del montar l'ardita foga,per le scalee che si fero ad etade,ch'era sicuro il quaderno e la doga
allor fec' io come color che vanno,con cosa in capo non da lor saputa,se non che ' cenni altrui sospecciar fanno
e con le dita de la destra scempie,trovai pur sei le lettere che 'ncise,quel da le chiavi a me sovra le tempie
noi eravamo al sommo de la scala,dove secondamente si risega,lo monte che salendo altrui dismala
tu scaldi il mondo tu sovr' esso luci,s'altra ragione in contrario non ponta,esser dien sempre li tuoi raggi duci
lo fren vuol esser del contrario suono,credo che l'udirai per mio avviso,prima che giunghi al passo del perdono
di vil ciliccio mi parean coperti,e l'un sofferia l'altro con la spalla,e tutti da la ripa eran sofferti
a me pareva andando fare oltraggio,veggendo altrui non essendo veduto,per ch'io mi volsi al mio consiglio saggio
eran li cittadin miei presso a colle,in campo giunti co' loro avversari,e io pregava iddio di quel ch'e' volle
pace volli con dio in su lo stremo,de la mia vita e ancor non sarebbe,lo mio dover per penitenza scemo
io veggio tuo nepote che diventa,cacciator di quei lupi in su la riva,del fiero fiume e tutti li sgomenta
sanguinoso esce de la trista selva,lasciala tal che di qui a mille anni,ne lo stato primaio non si rinselva
com' a l'annunzio di dogliosi danni,si turba il viso di colui ch'ascolta,da qual che parte il periglio l'assanni
lo dir de l'una e de l'altra la vista,mi fer voglioso di saper lor nomi,e dimanda ne fei con prieghi mista
quando in bologna un fabbro si ralligna,quando in faenza un bernardin di fosco,verga gentil di picciola gramigna
non ti maravigliar s'io piango tosco,quando rimembro con guido da prata,ugolin d'azzo che vivette nosco
poi fummo fatti soli procedendo,folgore parve quando l'aere fende,voce che giunse di contra dicendo
chiamavi 'l cielo e 'ntorno vi si gira,mostrandovi le sue bellezze etterne,e l'occhio vostro pur a terra mira
ond' io levai le mani inver' la cima,de le mie ciglia e fecimi 'l solecchio,che del soverchio visibile lima
come quando da l'acqua o da lo specchio,salta lo raggio a l'opposita parte,salendo su per lo modo parecchio
lo mio maestro e io soli amendue,suso andavamo e io pensai andando,prode acquistar ne le parole sue
ma se l'amor de la spera supprema,torcesse in suso il disiderio vostro,non vi sarebbe al petto quella tema
ecco dolenti lo tuo padre e io,ti cercavamo,e come qui si tacque
noi andavam per lo vespero attenti,oltre quanto potean li occhi allungarsi,contra i raggi serotini e lucenti
io sentia voci e ciascuna pareva,pregar per pace e per misericordia,l'agnel di dio che le peccata leva
e se dio m'ha in sua grazia rinchiuso,tanto che vuol ch'i' veggia la sua corte,per modo tutto fuor del moderno uso
non mi celar chi fosti anzi la morte,ma dilmi e dimmi s'i' vo bene al varco,e tue parole fier le nostre scorte
voi che vivete ogne cagion recate,pur suso al cielo pur come se tutto,movesse seco di necessitate
e libero voler che se fatica,ne le prime battaglie col ciel dura,poi vince tutto se ben si notrica
a maggior forza e a miglior natura,liberi soggiacete e quella cria,la mente in voi che 'l ciel non ha in sua cura
esce di mano a lui che la vagheggia,prima che sia a guisa di fanciulla,che piangendo e ridendo pargoleggia
di picciol bene in pria sente sapore,quivi s'inganna e dietro ad esso corre,se guida o fren non torce suo amore
onde convenne legge per fren porre,convenne rege aver che discernesse,de la vera cittade almen la torre
soleva roma che 'l buon mondo feo,due soli aver che l'una e l'altra strada,facean vedere e del mondo e di deo
in sul paese ch'adice e po riga,solea valore e cortesia trovarsi,prima che federigo avesse briga
currado da palazzo e 'l buon gherardo,e guido da castel che mei si noma,francescamente il semplice lombardo
ricorditi lettor se mai ne l'alpe,ti colse nebbia per la qual vedessi,non altrimenti che per pelle talpe
come quando i vapori umidi e spessi,a diradar cominciansi la spera,del sol debilemente entra per essi
poi piovve dentro a l'alta fantasia,un crucifisso dispettoso e fero,ne la sua vista e cotal si moria
come si frange il sonno ove di butto,nova luce percuote il viso chiuso,che fratto guizza pria che muoia tutto
e fece la mia voglia tanto pronta,di riguardar chi era che parlava,che mai non posa se non si raffronta
e io attesi un poco s'io udissi,alcuna cosa nel novo girone,poi mi volsi al maestro mio e dissi
quinci comprender puoi ch'esser convene,amor sementa in voi d'ogne virtute,e d'ogne operazion che merta pene
ciascun confusamente un bene apprende,nel qual si queti l'animo e disira,per che di giugner lui ciascun contende
se lento amore a lui veder vi tira,o a lui acquistar questa cornice,dopo giusto penter ve ne martira
l'amor ch'ad esso troppo s'abbandona,di sovr' a noi si piange per tre cerchi,ma come tripartito si ragiona
posto avea fine al suo ragionamento,l'alto dottore e attento guardava,ne la mia vista s'io parea contento
ma quel padre verace che s'accorse,del timido voler che non s'apriva,parlando di parlare ardir mi porse
e correa contro 'l ciel per quelle strade,che 'l sole infiamma allor che quel da roma,tra ' sardi e ' corsi il vede quando cade
per ch'io che la ragione aperta e piana,sovra le mie quistioni avea ricolta,stava com' om che sonnolento vana
cotal per quel giron suo passo falca,per quel ch'io vidi di color venendo,cui buon volere e giusto amor cavalca
io fui abate in san zeno a verona,sotto lo 'mperio del buon barbarossa,di cui dolente ancor milan ragiona
ancor non era sua bocca richiusa,quand' una donna apparve santa e presta,lunghesso me per far colei confusa
bastiti e batti a terra le calcagne,li occhi rivolgi al logoro che gira,lo rege etterno con le rote magne
tal mi fec' io e tal quanto si fende,la roccia per dar via a chi va suso,n'andai infin dove 'l cerchiar si prende
com' io nel quinto giro fui dischiuso,vidi gente per esso che piangea,giacendo a terra tutta volta in giuso
poi ch'io potei di me fare a mio senno,trassimi sovra quella creatura,le cui parole pria notar mi fenno
fino a quel punto misera e partita,da dio anima fui del tutto avara,or come vedi qui ne son punita
ne' piedi e ne le man legati e presi,e quanto fia piacer del giusto sire,tanto staremo immobili e distesi
io m'era inginocchiato e volea dire,ma com' io cominciai ed el s'accorse,solo ascoltando del mio reverire
contra miglior voler voler mal pugna,onde contra 'l piacer mio per piacerli,trassi de l'acqua non sazia la spugna
mossimi e 'l duca mio si mosse per li,luoghi spediti pur lungo la roccia,come si va per muro stretto a' merli
noi andavam con passi lenti e scarsi,e io attento a l'ombre ch'i' sentia,pietosamente piangere e lagnarsi
ma se doagio lilla guanto e bruggia,potesser tosto ne saria vendetta,e io la cheggio a lui che tutto giuggia
figliuol fu' io d'un beccaio di parigi,quando li regi antichi venner meno,tutti fuor ch'un renduto in panni bigi
ch'a la corona vedova promossa,la testa di mio figlio fu dal quale,cominciar di costor le sacrate ossa
mentre che la gran dota provenzale,al sangue mio non tolse la vergogna,poco valea ma pur non facea male
veggiolo un'altra volta esser deriso,veggio rinovellar l'aceto e 'l fiele,e tra vivi ladroni esser anciso
talor parla l'uno alto e l'altro basso,secondo l'affezion ch'ad ir ci sprona,ora a maggiore e ora a minor passo
quand' io senti' come cosa che cada,tremar lo monte onde mi prese un gelo,qual prender suol colui ch'a morte vada
mi travagliava e pungeami la fretta,per la 'mpacciata via dietro al mio duca,e condoleami a la giusta vendetta
de la mondizia sol voler fa prova,che tutto libero a mutar convento,l'alma sorprende e di voler le giova
prima vuol ben ma non lascia il talento,che divina giustizia contra voglia,come fu al peccar pone al tormento
or son io d'una parte e d'altra preso,l'una mi fa tacer l'altra scongiura,ch'io dica ond' io sospiro e sono inteso
se cagion altra al mio rider credesti,lasciala per non vera ed esser credi,quelle parole che di lui dicesti
la tua dimanda tuo creder m'avvera,esser ch'i' fossi avaro in l'altra vita,forse per quella cerchia dov' io era
or sappi ch'avarizia fu partita,troppo da me e questa dismisura,migliaia di lunari hanno punita
quanti risurgeran coi crini scemi,per ignoranza che di questa pecca,toglie 'l penter vivendo e ne li stremi
e sappie che la colpa che rimbecca,per dritta opposizione alcun peccato,con esso insieme qui suo verde secca
e la parola tua sopra toccata,si consonava a' nuovi predicanti,ond' io a visitarli presi usata
vennermi poi parendo tanto santi,che quando domizian li perseguette,sanza mio lagrimar non fur lor pianti
e pria ch'io conducessi i greci a' fiumi,di tebe poetando ebb' io battesmo,ma per paura chiuso cristian fu'mi
tu dunque che levato hai il coperchio,che m'ascondeva quanto bene io dico,mentre che del salire avem soverchio
elli givan dinanzi e io soletto,di retro e ascoltava i lor sermoni,ch'a poetar mi davano intelletto
ma tosto ruppe le dolci ragioni,un alber che trovammo in mezza strada,con pomi a odorar soavi e buoni
dal lato onde 'l cammin nostro era chiuso,cadea de l'alta roccia un liquor chiaro,e si spandeva per le foglie suso
ne li occhi era ciascuna oscura e cava,palida ne la faccia e tanto scema,che da l'ossa la pelle s'informava
questa favilla tutta mi raccese,mia conoscenza a la cangiata labbia,e ravvisai la faccia di forese
di bere e di mangiar n'accende cura,l'odor ch'esce del pomo e de lo sprazzo,che si distende su per sua verdura
e non pur una volta questo spazzo,girando si rinfresca nostra pena,io dico pena e dovria dir sollazzo
con suoi prieghi devoti e con sospiri,tratto m'ha de la costa ove s'aspetta,e liberato m'ha de li altri giri
quai barbare fuor mai quai saracine,cui bisognasse per farle ir coperte,o spiritali o altre discipline
e l'ombre che parean cose rimorte,per le fosse de li occhi ammirazione,traean di me di mio vivere accorte
ebbe la santa chiesa in le sue braccia,dal torso fu e purga per digiuno,l'anguille di bolsena e la vernaccia
tu te n'andrai con questo antivedere,se nel mio mormorar prendesti errore,dichiareranti ancor le cose vere
io veggio ben come le vostre penne,di retro al dittator sen vanno strette,che de le nostre certo non avvenne
qual esce alcuna volta di gualoppo,lo cavalier di schiera che cavalchi,e va per farsi onor del primo intoppo
e quando innanzi a noi intrato fue,che li occhi miei si fero a lui seguaci,come la mente a le parole sue
vidi gente sott' esso alzar le mani,e gridar non so che verso le fronde,quasi bramosi fantolini e vani
che pregano e 'l pregato non risponde,ma per fare esser ben la voglia acuta,tien alto lor disio e nol nasconde
l'aspetto suo m'avea la vista tolta,per ch'io mi volsi dietro a' miei dottori,com' om che va secondo ch'elli ascolta
e quale annunziatrice de li albori,l'aura di maggio movesi e olezza,tutta impregnata da l'erba e da' fiori
per che come fa l'uom che non s'affigge,ma vassi a la via sua che che li appaia,se di bisogno stimolo il trafigge
tal era io con voglia accesa e spenta,di dimandar venendo infino a l'atto,che fa colui ch'a dicer s'argomenta
sangue perfetto che poi non si beve,da l'assetate vene e si rimane,quasi alimento che di mensa leve
prende nel core a tutte membra umane,virtute informativa come quello,ch'a farsi quelle per le vene vane
ivi s'accoglie l'uno e l'altro insieme,l'un disposto a patire e l'altro a fare,per lo perfetto loco onde si preme
quindi parliamo e quindi ridiam noi,quindi facciam le lagrime e ' sospiri,che per lo monte aver sentiti puoi
quivi la ripa fiamma in fuor balestra,e la cornice spira fiato in suso,che la reflette e via da lei sequestra
e vidi spirti per la fiamma andando,per ch'io guardava a loro e a' miei passi,compartendo la vista a quando a quando
indi al cantar tornavano indi donne,gridavano e mariti che fuor casti,come virtute e matrimonio imponne
e questo modo credo che lor basti,per tutto il tempo che 'l foco li abbruscia,con tal cura conviene e con tai pasti
poi come grue ch'a le montagne rife,volasser parte e parte inver' l'arene,queste del gel quelle del sole schife
e raccostansi a me come davanti,essi medesmi che m'avean pregato,attenti ad ascoltar ne' lor sembianti
non altrimenti stupido si turba,lo montanaro e rimirando ammuta,quando rozzo e salvatico s'inurba
che ciascun' ombra fece in sua paruta,ma poi che furon di stupore scarche,lo qual ne li alti cuor tosto s'attuta
quali ne la tristizia di ligurgo,si fer due figli a riveder la madre,tal mi fec' io ma non a tanto insurgo
poi che di riguardar pasciuto fui,tutto m'offersi pronto al suo servigio,con l'affermar che fa credere altrui
poi forse per dar luogo altrui secondo,che presso avea disparve per lo foco,come per l'acqua il pesce andando al fondo
ieu sui arnaut que plor e vau cantan,consiros vei la passada folor,e vei jausen lo joi qu'esper denan
ara vos prec per aquella valor,que vos guida al som de l'escalina,sovenha vos a temps de ma dolor
credi per certo che se dentro a l'alvo,di questa fiamma stessi ben mille anni,non ti potrebbe far d'un capel calvo
e se tu forse credi ch'io t'inganni,fatti ver' lei e fatti far credenza,con le tue mani al lembo d'i tuoi panni
poi dentro al foco innanzi mi si mise,pregando stazio che venisse retro,che pria per lunga strada ci divise
e di pochi scaglion levammo i saggi,che 'l sol corcar per l'ombra che si spense,sentimmo dietro e io e li miei saggi
e pria che 'n tutte le sue parti immense,fosse orizzonte fatto d'uno aspetto,e notte avesse tutte sue dispense
quali si stanno ruminando manse,le capre state rapide e proterve,sovra le cime avante che sien pranse
tali eravamo tutti e tre allotta,io come capra ed ei come pastori,fasciati quinci e quindi d'alta grotta
giovane e bella in sogno mi parea,donna vedere andar per una landa,cogliendo fiori e cantando dicea
per piacermi a lo specchio qui m'addorno,ma mia suora rachel mai non si smaga,dal suo miraglio e siede tutto giorno
tratto t'ho qui con ingegno e con arte,lo tuo piacere omai prendi per duce,fuor se' de l'erte vie fuor se' de l'arte
mentre che vegnan lieti li occhi belli,che lagrimando a te venir mi fenno,seder ti puoi e puoi andar tra elli
per cui le fronde tremolando pronte,tutte quante piegavano a la parte,u' la prim' ombra gitta il santo monte
ma con piena letizia l'ore prime,cantando ricevieno intra le foglie,che tenevan bordone a le sue rime
una donna soletta che si gia,e cantando e scegliendo fior da fiore,ond' era pinta tutta la sua via
tu mi fai rimembrar dove e qual era,proserpina nel tempo che perdette,la madre lei ed ella primavera
volsesi in su i vermigli e in su i gialli,fioretti verso me non altrimenti,che vergine che li occhi onesti avvalli
non credo che splendesse tanto lume,sotto le ciglia a venere trafitta,dal figlio fuor di tutto suo costume
maravigliando tienvi alcun sospetto,ma luce rende il salmo delectasti,che puote disnebbiar vostro intelletto
e la percossa pianta tanto puote,che de la sua virtute l'aura impregna,e quella poi girando intorno scuote
l'acqua che vedi non surge di vena,che ristori vapor che gel converta,come fiume ch'acquista e perde lena
ma esce di fontana salda e certa,che tanto dal voler di dio riprende,quant' ella versa da due parti aperta
allor si mosse contra 'l fiume andando,su per la riva e io pari di lei,picciol passo con picciol seguitando
non eran cento tra ' suoi passi e ' miei,quando le ripe igualmente dier volta,per modo ch'a levante mi rendei
io mi rivolsi d'ammirazion pieno,al buon virgilio ed esso mi rispuose,con vista carca di stupor non meno
quand' io da la mia riva ebbi tal posta,che solo il fiume mi facea distante,per veder meglio ai passi diedi sosta
questi ostendali in dietro eran maggiori,che la mia vista e quanto a mio avviso,diece passi distavan quei di fori
poscia che i fiori e l'altre fresche erbette,a rimpetto di me da l'altra sponda,libere fuor da quelle genti elette
ognuno era pennuto di sei ali,le penne piene d'occhi e li occhi d'argo,se fosser vivi sarebber cotali
tanto salivan che non eran viste,le membra d'oro avea quant' era uccello,e bianche l'altre di vermiglio miste
tre donne in giro da la destra rota,venian danzando l'una tanto rossa,ch'a pena fora dentro al foco nota
da la sinistra quattro facean festa,in porpore vestite dietro al modo,d'una di lor ch'avea tre occhi in testa
appresso tutto il pertrattato nodo,vidi due vecchi in abito dispari,ma pari in atto e onesto e sodo
poi vidi quattro in umile paruta,e di retro da tutti un vecchio solo,venir dormendo con la faccia arguta
anzi di rose e d'altri fior vermigli,giurato avria poco lontano aspetto,che tutti ardesser di sopra da' cigli
quali i beati al novissimo bando,surgeran presti ognun di sua caverna,la revestita voce alleluiando
cotali in su la divina basterna,si levar cento ad vocem tanti senis,ministri e messaggier di vita etterna
sovra candido vel cinta d'uliva,donna m'apparve sotto verde manto,vestita di color di fiamma viva
quasi ammiraglio che in poppa e in prora,viene a veder la gente che ministra,per li altri legni e a ben far l'incora
vidi la donna che pria m'appario,velata sotto l'angelica festa,drizzar li occhi ver' me di qua dal rio
tutto che 'l vel che le scendea di testa,cerchiato de le fronde di minerva,non la lasciasse parer manifesta
non pur per ovra de le rote magne,che drizzan ciascun seme ad alcun fine,secondo che le stelle son compagne
e volse i passi suoi per via non vera,imagini di ben seguendo false,che nulla promession rendono intera
come balestro frange quando scocca,da troppa tesa la sua corda e l'arco,e con men foga l'asta il segno tocca
e quali agevolezze o quali avanzi,ne la fronte de li altri si mostraro,per che dovessi lor passeggiare anzi
dopo la tratta d'un sospiro amaro,a pena ebbi la voce che rispuose,e le labbra a fatica la formaro
novo augelletto due o tre aspetta,ma dinanzi da li occhi d'i pennuti,rete si spiega indarno o si saetta
con men di resistenza si dibarba,robusto cerro o vero al nostral vento,o vero a quel de la terra di iarba
ch'io non levai al suo comando il mento,e quando per la barba il viso chiese,ben conobbi il velen de l'argomento
tanta riconoscenza il cor mi morse,ch'io caddi vinto e quale allora femmi,salsi colei che la cagion mi porse
tratto m'avea nel fiume infin la gola,e tirandosi me dietro sen giva,sovresso l'acqua lieve come scola
la bella donna ne le braccia aprissi,abbracciommi la testa e mi sommerse,ove convenne ch'io l'acqua inghiottissi
indi mi tolse e bagnato m'offerse,dentro a la danza de le quattro belle,e ciascuna del braccio mi coperse
come in lo specchio il sol non altrimenti,la doppia fiera dentro vi raggiava,or con altri or con altri reggimenti
tant' eran li occhi miei fissi e attenti,a disbramarsi la decenne sete,che li altri sensi m'eran tutti spenti
quella milizia del celeste regno,che procedeva tutta trapassonne,pria che piegasse il carro il primo legno
turgide fansi e poi si rinovella,di suo color ciascuna pria che 'l sole,giunga li suoi corsier sotto altra stella
come pintor che con essempro pinga,disegnerei com' io m'addormentai,ma qual vuol sia che l'assonnar ben finga
pietro e giovanni e iacopo condotti,e vinti ritornaro a la parola,da la qual furon maggior sonni rotti
tal torna' io e vidi quella pia,sovra me starsi che conducitrice,fu de' miei passi lungo 'l fiume pria
ma riprendendo lei di laide colpe,la donna mia la volse in tanta futa,quanto sofferser l'ossa sanza polpe
quel che rimase come da gramigna,vivace terra da la piuma offerta,forse con intenzion sana e benigna
le prime eran cornute come bue,ma le quattro un sol corno avean per fronte,simile mostro visto ancor non fue
sicura quasi rocca in alto monte,seder sovresso una puttana sciolta,m'apparve con le ciglia intorno pronte
poi di sospetto pieno e d'ira crudo,disciolse il mostro e trassel per la selva,tanto che sol di lei mi fece scudo
ma poi che l'altre vergini dier loco,a lei di dir levata dritta in pe,rispuose colorata come foco
come a color che troppo reverenti,dinanzi a suo maggior parlando sono,che non traggon la voce viva ai denti
e forse che la mia narrazion buia,qual temi e sfinge men ti persuade,perch' a lor modo lo 'ntelletto attuia
ma tosto fier li fatti le naiade,che solveranno questo enigma forte,sanza danno di pecore o di biade
e se stati non fossero acqua d'elsa,li pensier vani intorno a la tua mente,e 'l piacer loro un piramo a la gelsa
per tante circostanze solamente,la giustizia di dio ne l'interdetto,conosceresti a l'arbor moralmente
voglio anco e se non scritto almen dipinto,che 'l te ne porti dentro a te per quello,che si reca il bordon di palma cinto
veramente oramai saranno nude,le mie parole quanto converrassi,quelle scovrire a la tua vista rude
le sette donne al fin d'un'ombra smorta,qual sotto foglie verdi e rami nigri,sovra suoi freddi rivi l'alpe porta
matelda che 'l ti dica,e qui rispuose,come fa chi da colpa si dislega
surge ai mortali per diverse foci,la lucerna del mondo ma da quella,che quattro cerchi giugne con tre croci
s'i' era sol di me quel che creasti,novellamente amor che 'l ciel governi,tu 'l sai che col tuo lume mi levasti
parvemi tanto allor del cielo acceso,de la fiamma del sol che pioggia o fiume,lago non fece alcun tanto disteso
onde si muovono a diversi porti,per lo gran mar de l'essere e ciascuna,con istinto a lei dato che la porti
o voi che siete in piccioletta barca,desiderosi d'ascoltar seguiti,dietro al mio legno che cantando varca
voialtri pochi che drizzaste il collo,per tempo al pan de li angeli del quale,vivesi qui ma non sen vien satollo
metter potete ben per l'alto sale,vostro navigio servando mio solco,dinanzi a l'acqua che ritorna equale
beatrice in suso e io in lei guardava,e forse in tanto in quanto un quadrel posa,e vola e da la noce si dischiava
parev' a me che nube ne coprisse,lucida spessa solida e pulita,quasi adamante che lo sol ferisse
s'io era corpo e qui non si concepe,com' una dimensione altra patio,ch'esser convien se corpo in corpo repe
certo non ti dovrien punger li strali,d'ammirazione omai poi dietro ai sensi,vedi che la ragione ha corte l'ali
la spera ottava vi dimostra molti,lumi li quali e nel quale e nel quanto,notar si posson di diversi volti
se 'l primo fosse fora manifesto,ne l'eclissi del sol per trasparere,lo lume come in altro raro ingesto
rivolto ad essi fa che dopo il dosso,ti stea un lume che i tre specchi accenda,e torni a te da tutti ripercosso
or come ai colpi de li caldi rai,de la neve riman nudo il suggetto,e dal colore e dal freddo primai
dentro dal ciel de la divina pace,si gira un corpo ne la cui virtute,l'esser di tutto suo contento giace
lo ciel seguente c'ha tante vedute,quell' esser parte per diverse essenze,da lui distratte e da lui contenute
e 'l ciel cui tanti lumi fanno bello,de la mente profonda che lui volve,prende l'image e fassene suggello
e come l'alma dentro a vostra polve,per differenti membra e conformate,a diverse potenze si risolve
e nulla vidi e ritorsili avanti,dritti nel lume de la dolce guida,che sorridendo ardea ne li occhi santi
li nostri affetti che solo infiammati,son nel piacer de lo spirito santo,letizian del suo ordine formati
con quelle altr' ombre pria sorrise un poco,da indi mi rispuose tanto lieta,ch'arder parea d'amor nel primo foco
dal mondo per seguirla giovinetta,fuggi'mi e nel suo abito mi chiusi,e promisi la via de la sua setta
e quest' altro splendor che ti si mostra,da la mia destra parte e che s'accende,di tutto il lume de la spera nostra
la vista mia che tanto lei seguio,quanto possibil fu poi che la perse,volsesi al segno di maggior disio
intra due cibi distanti e moventi,d'un modo prima si morria di fame,che liber' omo l'un recasse ai denti
per questo la scrittura condescende,a vostra facultate e piedi e mano,attribuisce a dio e altro intende
dice che l'alma a la sua stella riede,credendo quella quindi esser decisa,quando natura per forma la diede
s'elli intende tornare a queste ruote,l'onor de la influenza e 'l biasmo forse,in alcun vero suo arco percuote
se fosse stato lor volere intero,come tenne lorenzo in su la grada,e fece muzio a la sua man severo
ma or ti s'attraversa un altro passo,dinanzi a li occhi tal che per te stesso,non usciresti: pria saresti lasso
posasi in esso come fera in lustra,tosto che giunto l'ha e giugner puollo,se non ciascun disio sarebbe frustra
dunque che render puossi per ristoro,se credi bene usar quel c'hai offerto,di maltolletto vuo' far buon lavoro
ma non trasmuti carco a la sua spalla,per suo arbitrio alcun sanza la volta,e de la chiave bianca e de la gialla
avete il novo e 'l vecchio testamento,e 'l pastor de la chiesa che vi guida,questo vi basti a vostro salvamento
non fate com' agnel che lascia il latte,de la sua madre e semplice e lascivo,seco medesmo a suo piacer combatte
tosto che con la chiesa mossi i piedi,a dio per grazia piacque di spirarmi,l'alto lavoro e tutto 'n lui mi diedi
or qui a la question prima s'appunta,la mia risposta ma sua condizione,mi stringe a seguitare alcuna giunta
tu sai ch'el fece in alba sua dimora,per trecento anni e oltre infino al fine,che i tre a' tre pugnar per lui ancora
onde torquato e quinzio che dal cirro,negletto fu nomato i deci e ' fabi,ebber la fama che volontier mirro
poi presso al tempo che tutto 'l ciel volle,redur lo mondo a suo modo sereno,cesare per voler di roma il tolle
da indi scese folgorando a iuba,onde si volse nel vostro occidente,ove sentia la pompeana tuba
piangene ancor la trista cleopatra,che fuggendoli innanzi dal colubro,la morte prese subitana e atra
con costui corse infino al lito rubro,con costui puose il mondo in tanta pace,che fu serrato a giano il suo delubro
diventa in apparenza poco e scuro,se in mano al terzo cesare si mira,con occhio chiaro e con affetto puro
e quando il dente longobardo morse,la santa chiesa sotto le sue ali,carlo magno vincendo la soccorse
omai puoi giudicar di quei cotali,ch'io accusai di sopra e di lor falli,che son cagion di tutti vostri mali
e dentro a la presente margarita,luce la luce di romeo di cui,fu l'ovra grande e bella mal gradita
indi partissi povero e vetusto,e se 'l mondo sapesse il cor ch'elli ebbe,mendicando sua vita a frusto a frusto
ma quella reverenza che s'indonna,di tutto me pur per be e per ice,mi richinava come l'uom ch'assonna
or drizza il viso a quel ch'or si ragiona,questa natura al suo fattore unita,qual fu creata fu sincera e buona
ma io veggi' or la tua mente ristretta,di pensiero in pensier dentro ad un nodo,del qual con gran disio solver s'aspetta
ficca mo l'occhio per entro l'abisso,de l'etterno consiglio quanto puoi,al mio parlar distrettamente fisso
dunque a dio convenia con le vie sue,riparar l'omo a sua intera vita,dico con l'una o ver con amendue
tu dici: io veggio l'acqua io veggio il foco,l'aere e la terra e tutte lor misture,venire a corruzione e durar poco
e quinci puoi argomentare ancora,vostra resurrezion se tu ripensi,come l'umana carne fessi allora
solea creder lo mondo in suo periclo,che la bella ciprigna il folle amore,raggiasse volta nel terzo epiciclo
per che non pur a lei faceano onore,di sacrificio e di votivo grido,le genti antiche ne l'antico errore
e da costei ond' io principio piglio,pigliavano il vocabol de la stella,che 'l sol vagheggia or da coppa or da ciglio
di fredda nube non disceser venti,o visibili o no tanto festini,che non paressero impediti e lenti
a chi avesse quei lumi divini,veduti a noi venir lasciando il giro,pria cominciato in li alti serafini
la mia letizia mi ti tien celato,che mi raggia dintorno e mi nasconde,quasi animal di sua seta fasciato
e quel corno d'ausonia che s'imborga,di bari e di gaeta e di catona,da ove tronto e verde in mare sgorga
e la bella trinacria che caliga,tra pachino e peloro sopra 'l golfo,che riceve da euro maggior briga
non per tifeo ma per nascente solfo,attesi avrebbe li suoi regi ancora,nati per me di carlo e di ridolfo
se mala segnoria che sempre accora,li popoli suggetti non avesse,mosso palermo a gridar: mora mora
la sua natura che di larga parca,discese avria mestier di tal milizia,che non curasse di mettere in arca
lo ben che tutto il regno che tu scandi,volge e contenta fa esser virtute,sua provedenza in questi corpi grandi
natura generata il suo cammino,simil farebbe sempre a' generanti,se non vincesse il proveder divino
ed ecco un altro di quelli splendori,ver' me si fece e 'l suo voler piacermi,significava nel chiarir di fori
onde la luce che m'era ancor nova,del suo profondo ond' ella pria cantava,seguette come a cui di ben far giova
ma lietamente a me medesma indulgo,la cagion di mia sorte e non mi noia,che parria forse forte al vostro vulgo
troppo sarebbe larga la bigoncia,che ricevesse il sangue ferrarese,e stanco chi 'l pesasse a oncia a oncia
qui si tacette e fecemi sembiante,che fosse ad altro volta per la rota,in che si mise com' era davante
dunque la voce tua che 'l ciel trastulla,sempre col canto di quei fuochi pii,che di sei ali facen la coculla
di quella valle fu' io litorano,tra ebro e macra che per cammin corto,parte lo genovese dal toscano
folco mi disse quella gente a cui,fu noto il nome mio e questo cielo,di me s'imprenta com' io fe' di lui
ma vaticano e l'altre parti elette,di roma che son state cimitero,a la milizia che pietro seguette
guardando nel suo figlio con l'amore,che l'uno e l'altro etternalmente spira,lo primo e ineffabile valore
leva dunque lettore a l'alte rote,meco la vista dritto a quella parte,dove l'un moto e l'altro si percuote
vedi come da indi si dirama,l'oblico cerchio che i pianeti porta,per sodisfare al mondo che li chiama
lo ministro maggior de la natura,che del valor del ciel lo mondo imprenta,e col suo lume il tempo ne misura
e io era con lui ma del salire,non m'accors' io se non com' uom s'accorge,anzi 'l primo pensier del suo venire
tal era quivi la quarta famiglia,de l'alto padre che sempre la sazia,mostrando come spira e come figlia
ne la corte del cielo ond' io rivegno,si trovan molte gioie care e belle,tanto che non si posson trar del regno
donne mi parver non da ballo sciolte,ma che s'arrestin tacite ascoltando,fin che le nove note hanno ricolte
multiplicato in te tanto resplende,che ti conduce su per quella scala,u' sanza risalir nessun discende
tu vuo' saper di quai piante s'infiora,questa ghirlanda che 'ntorno vagheggia,la bella donna ch'al ciel t'avvalora
io fui de li agni de la santa greggia,che domenico mena per cammino,u' ben s'impingua se non si vaneggia
l'altro ch'appresso addorna il nostro coro,quel pietro fu che con la poverella,offerse a santa chiesa suo tesoro
ne l'altra piccioletta luce ride,quello avvocato de' tempi cristiani,del cui latino augustin si provide
per vedere ogne ben dentro vi gode,l'anima santa che 'l mondo fallace,fa manifesto a chi di lei ben ode
lo corpo ond' ella fu cacciata giace,giuso in cieldauro ed essa da martiro,e da essilio venne a questa pace
o insensata cura de' mortali,quanto son difettivi silogismi,quei che ti fanno in basso batter l'ali
chi dietro a iura e chi ad amforismi,sen giva e chi seguendo sacerdozio,e chi regnar per forza o per sofismi
e chi rubare e chi civil negozio,chi nel diletto de la carne involto,s'affaticava e chi si dava a l'ozio
poi che ciascuno fu tornato ne lo,punto del cerchio in che avanti s'era,fermossi come a candellier candelo
intra tupino e l'acqua che discende,del colle eletto dal beato ubaldo,fertile costa d'alto monte pende
onde perugia sente freddo e caldo,da porta sole e di rietro le piange,per grave giogo nocera con gualdo
la lor concordia e i lor lieti sembianti,amore e maraviglia e dolce sguardo,facieno esser cagion di pensier santi
oh ignota ricchezza,oh ben ferace,scalzasi egidio scalzasi silvestro
poi che la gente poverella crebbe,dietro a costui la cui mirabil vita,meglio in gloria del ciel si canterebbe
di seconda corona redimita,fu per onorio da l'etterno spiro,la santa voglia d'esto archimandrita
e per trovare a conversione acerba,troppo la gente e per non stare indarno,redissi al frutto de l'italica erba
nel crudo sasso intra tevero e arno,da cristo prese l'ultimo sigillo,che le sue membra due anni portarno
e del suo grembo l'anima preclara,mover si volle tornando al suo regno,e al suo corpo non volle altra bara
pensa oramai qual fu colui che degno,collega fu a mantener la barca,di pietro in alto mar per dritto segno
e nel suo giro tutta non si volse,prima ch'un'altra di cerchio la chiuse,e moto a moto e canto a canto colse
canto che tanto vince nostre muse,nostre serene in quelle dolci tube,quanto primo splendor quel ch'e' refuse
come si volgon per tenera nube,due archi paralelli e concolori,quando iunone a sua ancella iube
nascendo di quel d'entro quel di fori,a guisa del parlar di quella vaga,ch'amor consunse come sol vapori
insieme a punto e a voler quetarsi,pur come li occhi ch'al piacer che i move,conviene insieme chiudere e levarsi
del cor de l'una de le luci nove,si mosse voce che l'ago a la stella,parer mi fece in volgermi al suo dove
quando lo 'mperador che sempre regna,provide a la milizia ch'era in forse,per sola grazia non per esser degna
in quella parte ove surge ad aprire,zefiro dolce le novelle fronde,di che si vede europa rivestire
non molto lungi al percuoter de l'onde,dietro a le quali per la lunga foga,lo sol talvolta ad ogne uom si nasconde
siede la fortunata calaroga,sotto la protezion del grande scudo,in che soggiace il leone e soggioga
dentro vi nacque l'amoroso drudo,de la fede cristiana il santo atleta,benigno a' suoi e a' nemici crudo
la donna che per lui l'assenso diede,vide nel sonno il mirabile frutto,ch'uscir dovea di lui e de le rede
oh padre suo veramente felice,oh madre sua veramente giovanna,se interpretata val come si dice
non dispensare o due o tre per sei,non la fortuna di prima vacante,non decimas quae sunt pauperum dei
poi con dottrina e con volere insieme,con l'officio appostolico si mosse,quasi torrente ch'alta vena preme
se tal fu l'una rota de la biga,in che la santa chiesa si difese,e vinse in campo la sua civil briga
ben dico chi cercasse a foglio a foglio,nostro volume ancor troveria carta,u' leggerebbe i' mi son quel ch'i' soglio
io son la vita di bonaventura,da bagnoregio che ne' grandi offici,sempre pospuosi la sinistra cura
illuminato e augustin son quici,che fuor de' primi scalzi poverelli,che nel capestro a dio si fero amici
ad inveggiar cotanto paladino,mi mosse l'infiammata cortesia,di fra tommaso e 'l discreto latino
imagini chi bene intender cupe,quel ch'i' or vidi e ritegna l'image,mentre ch'io dico come ferma rupe
quindici stelle che 'n diverse plage,lo ciel avvivan di tanto sereno,che soperchia de l'aere ogne compage
imagini la bocca di quel corno,che si comincia in punta de lo stelo,a cui la prima rota va dintorno
e l'un ne l'altro aver li raggi suoi,e amendue girarsi per maniera,che l'uno andasse al primo e l'altro al poi
ruppe il silenzio ne' concordi numi,poscia la luce in che mirabil vita,del poverel di dio narrata fumi
tu credi che nel petto onde la costa,si trasse per formar la bella guancia,il cui palato a tutto 'l mondo costa
e in quel che forato da la lancia,e prima e poscia tanto sodisfece,che d'ogne colpa vince la bilancia
quantunque a la natura umana lece,aver di lume tutto fosse infuso,da quel valor che l'uno e l'altro fece
per sua bontate il suo raggiare aduna,quasi specchiato in nove sussistenze,etternalmente rimanendosi una
e queste contingenze essere intendo,le cose generate che produce,con seme e sanza seme il ciel movendo
ond' elli avvien ch'un medesimo legno,secondo specie meglio e peggio frutta,e voi nascete con diverso ingegno
e se al surse drizzi li occhi chiari,vedrai aver solamente respetto,ai regi che son molti e ' buon son rari
ch'i' ho veduto tutto 'l verno prima,lo prun mostrarsi rigido e feroce,poscia portar la rosa in su la cima
non creda donna berta e ser martino,per vedere un furare altro offerere,vederli dentro al consiglio divino
quell' uno e due e tre che sempre vive,e regna sempre in tre e 'n due e 'n uno,non circunscritto e tutto circunscrive
tre volte era cantato da ciascuno,di quelli spirti con tal melodia,ch'ad ogne merto saria giusto muno
forse non pur per lor ma per le mamme,per li padri e per li altri che fuor cari,anzi che fosser sempiterne fiamme
ed ecco intorno di chiarezza pari,nascere un lustro sopra quel che v'era,per guisa d'orizzonte che rischiari
e non er' anco del mio petto essausto,l'ardor del sacrificio ch'io conobbi,esso litare stato accetto e fausto
di corno in corno e tra la cima e 'l basso,si movien lumi scintillando forte,nel congiugnersi insieme e nel trapasso
moversi per lo raggio onde si lista,talvolta l'ombra che per sua difesa,la gente con ingegno e arte acquista
forse la mia parola par troppo osa,posponendo il piacer de li occhi belli,ne' quai mirando mio disio ha posa
come saranno a' giusti preghi sorde,quelle sustanze che per darmi voglia,ch'io le pregassi a tacer fur concorde
e pare stella che tramuti loco,se non che da la parte ond' e' s'accende,nulla sen perde ed esso dura poco
io mi volsi a beatrice e quella udio,pria ch'io parlassi e arrisemi un cenno,che fece crescer l'ali al voler mio
mio figlio fu e tuo bisavol fue,ben si convien che la lunga fatica,tu li raccorci con l'opere tue
fiorenza dentro da la cerchia antica,ond' ella toglie ancora e terza e nona,si stava in pace sobria e pudica
non faceva nascendo ancor paura,la figlia al padre che 'l tempo e la dote,non fuggien quinci e quindi la misura
bellincion berti vid' io andar cinto,di cuoio e d'osso e venir da lo specchio,la donna sua sanza 'l viso dipinto
e vidi quel d'i nerli e quel del vecchio,esser contenti a la pelle scoperta,e le sue donne al fuso e al pennecchio
l'altra traendo a la rocca la chioma,favoleggiava con la sua famiglia,d'i troiani di fiesole e di roma
saria tenuta allor tal maraviglia,una cianghella un lapo salterello,qual or saria cincinnato e corniglia
moronto fu mio frate ed eliseo,mia donna venne a me di val di pado,e quindi il sopranome tuo si feo
poi seguitai lo 'mperador currado,ed el mi cinse de la sua milizia,tanto per bene ovrar li venni in grado
dietro li andai incontro a la nequizia,di quella legge il cui popolo usurpa,per colpa d'i pastor vostra giustizia
quivi fu' io da quella gente turpa,disviluppato dal mondo fallace,lo cui amor molt' anime deturpa
onde beatrice ch'era un poco scevra,ridendo parve quella che tossio,al primo fallo scritto di ginevra
al suo leon cinquecento cinquanta,e trenta fiate venne questo foco,a rinfiammarsi sotto la sua pianta
tutti color ch'a quel tempo eran ivi,da poter arme tra marte e 'l batista,eran il quinto di quei ch'or son vivi
oh quanto fora meglio esser vicine,quelle genti ch'io dico e al galluzzo,e a trespiano aver vostro confine
sariesi montemurlo ancor de' conti,sarieno i cerchi nel piovier d'acone,e forse in valdigrieve i buondelmonti
sempre la confusion de le persone,principio fu del mal de la cittade,come del vostro il cibo che s'appone
se tu riguardi luni e orbisaglia,come sono ite e come se ne vanno,di retro ad esse chiusi e sinigaglia
l'oltracotata schiatta che s'indraca,dietro a chi fugge e a chi mostra 'l dente,o ver la borsa com' agnel si placa
ciascun che de la bella insegna porta,del gran barone il cui nome e 'l cui pregio,la festa di tommaso riconforta
da esso ebbe milizia e privilegio,avvegna che con popol si rauni,oggi colui che la fascia col fregio
la casa di che nacque il vostro fleto,per lo giusto disdegno che v'ha morti,e puose fine al vostro viver lieto
ma conveniesi a quella pietra scema,che guarda 'l ponte che fiorenza fesse,vittima ne la sua pace postrema
tal era io e tal era sentito,e da beatrice e da la santa lampa,che pria per me avea mutato sito
mentre ch'io era a virgilio congiunto,su per lo monte che l'anime cura,e discendendo nel mondo defunto
dette mi fuor di mia vita futura,parole gravi avvegna ch'io mi senta,ben tetragono ai colpi di ventura
ma per chiare parole e con preciso,latin rispuose quello amor paterno,chiuso e parvente del suo proprio riso
qual si partio ipolito d'atene,per la spietata e perfida noverca,tal di fiorenza partir ti convene
a lui t'aspetta e a' suoi benefici,per lui fia trasmutata molta gente,cambiando condizion ricchi e mendici
io cominciai come colui che brama,dubitando consiglio da persona,che vede e vuol dirittamente e ama
e poscia per lo ciel di lume in lume,ho io appreso quel che s'io ridico,a molti fia sapor di forte agrume
e s'io al vero son timido amico,temo di perder viver tra coloro,che questo tempo chiameranno antico
io mi rivolsi a l'amoroso suono,del mio conforto e qual io allor vidi,ne li occhi santi amor qui l'abbandono
tanto poss' io di quel punto ridire,che rimirando lei lo mio affetto,libero fu da ogne altro disire
e al nome de l'alto macabeo,vidi moversi un altro roteando,e letizia era ferza del paleo
poscia trasse guiglielmo e rinoardo,e 'l duca gottifredi la mia vista,per quella croce e ruberto guiscardo
indi tra l'altre luci mota e mista,mostrommi l'alma che m'avea parlato,qual era tra i cantor del cielo artista
io mi rivolsi dal mio destro lato,per vedere in beatrice il mio dovere,o per parlare o per atto segnato
e vidi le sue luci tanto mere,tanto gioconde che la sua sembianza,vinceva li altri e l'ultimo solere
prima cantando a sua nota moviensi,poi diventando l'un di questi segni,un poco s'arrestavano e taciensi
poi come nel percuoter d'i ciocchi arsi,surgono innumerabili faville,onde li stolti sogliono agurarsi
o dolce stella quali e quante gemme,mi dimostraro che nostra giustizia,effetto sia del ciel che tu ingemme
per ch'io prego la mente in che s'inizia,tuo moto e tua virtute che rimiri,ond' esce il fummo che 'l tuo raggio vizia
ma tu che sol per cancellare scrivi,pensa che pietro e paulo che moriro,per la vigna che guasti ancor son vivi
parea dinanzi a me con l'ali aperte,la bella image che nel dolce frui,liete facevan l'anime conserte
solvetemi spirando il gran digiuno,che lungamente m'ha tenuto in fame,non trovandoli in terra cibo alcuno
ben so io che se 'n cielo altro reame,la divina giustizia fa suo specchio,che 'l vostro non l'apprende con velame
quasi falcone ch'esce del cappello,move la testa e con l'ali si plaude,voglia mostrando e faccendosi bello
dunque vostra veduta che convene,esser alcun de' raggi de la mente,di che tutte le cose son ripiene
e tutti suoi voleri e atti buoni,sono quanto ragione umana vede,sanza peccato in vita o in sermoni
or tu chi se' che vuo' sedere a scranna,per giudicar di lungi mille miglia,con la veduta corta d'una spanna
certo a colui che meco s'assottiglia,se la scrittura sovra voi non fosse,da dubitar sarebbe a maraviglia
ma vedi: molti gridan cristo cristo,che saranno in giudicio assai men prope,a lui che tal che non conosce cristo
che poran dir li perse a' vostri regi,come vedranno quel volume aperto,nel qual si scrivon tutti suoi dispregi
e parranno a ciascun l'opere sozze,del barba e del fratel che tanto egregia,nazione e due corone han fatte bozze
oh beata ungheria se non si lascia,e beata navarra,se s'armasse del monte che la fascia
e questo atto del ciel mi venne a mente,come 'l segno del mondo e de' suoi duci,nel benedetto rostro fu tacente
o dolce amor che di riso t'ammanti,quanto parevi ardente in que' flailli,ch'avieno spirto sol di pensier santi
poscia che i cari e lucidi lapilli,ond' io vidi ingemmato il sesto lume,puoser silenzio a li angelici squilli
fecesi voce quivi e quindi uscissi,per lo suo becco in forma di parole,quali aspettava il core ov' io le scrissi
e quel che vedi ne l'arco declivo,guiglielmo fu cui quella terra plora,che piagne carlo e federigo vivo
ora conosce come s'innamora,lo ciel del giusto rege e al sembiante,del suo fulgore il fa vedere ancora
quale allodetta che 'n aere si spazia,prima cantando e poi tace contenta,de l'ultima dolcezza che la sazia
d'i corpi suoi non uscir come credi,gentili ma cristiani in ferma fede,quel d'i passuri e quel d'i passi piedi
e credendo s'accese in tanto foco,di vero amor ch'a la morte seconda,fu degna di venire a questo gioco
se non si temperasse tanto splende,che 'l tuo mortal podere al suo fulgore,sarebbe fronda che trono scoscende
qual savesse qual era la pastura,del viso mio ne l'aspetto beato,quand' io mi trasmutai ad altra cura
conoscerebbe quanto m'era a grato,ubidire a la mia celeste scorta,contrapesando l'un con l'altro lato
dentro al cristallo che 'l vocabol porta,cerchiando il mondo del suo caro duce,sotto cui giacque ogne malizia morta
di color d'oro in che raggio traluce,vid' io uno scaleo eretto in suso,tanto che nol seguiva la mia luce
vidi anche per li gradi scender giuso,tanti splendor ch'io pensai ch'ogne lume,che par nel ciel quindi fosse diffuso
e come per lo natural costume,le pole insieme al cominciar del giorno,si movono a scaldar le fredde piume
ma quella ond' io aspetto il come e 'l quando,del dire e del tacer si sta ond' io,contra 'l disio fo ben ch'io non dimando
che pur con cibi di liquor d'ulivi,lievemente passava caldi e geli,contento ne' pensier contemplativi
in quel loco fu' io pietro damiano,e pietro peccator fu' ne la casa,di nostra donna in sul lito adriano
poca vita mortal m'era rimasa,quando fui chiesto e tratto a quel cappello,che pur di male in peggio si travasa
or voglion quinci e quindi chi rincalzi,li moderni pastori e chi li meni,tanto son gravi e chi di rietro li alzi
come t'avrebbe trasmutato il canto,e io ridendo mo pensar lo puoi,poscia che 'l grido t'ha mosso cotanto
ma rivolgiti omai inverso altrui,ch'assai illustri spiriti vedrai,se com' io dico l'aspetto redui
questi altri fuochi tutti contemplanti,uomini fuoro accesi di quel caldo,che fa nascere i fiori e ' frutti santi
le mura che solieno esser badia,fatte sono spelonche e le cocolle,sacca son piene di farina ria
tu non avresti in tanto tratto e messo,nel foco il dito in quant' io vidi 'l segno,che segue il tauro e fui dentro da esso
col viso ritornai per tutte quante,le sette spere e vidi questo globo,tal ch'io sorrisi del suo vil sembiante
e quel consiglio per migliore approbo,che l'ha per meno e chi ad altro pensa,chiamar si puote veramente probo
e tutti e sette mi si dimostraro,quanto son grandi e quanto son veloci,e come sono in distante riparo
l'aiuola che ci fa tanto feroci,volgendom' io con li etterni gemelli,tutta m'apparve da' colli a le foci
come l'augello intra l'amate fronde,posato al nido de' suoi dolci nati,la notte che le cose ci nasconde
previene il tempo in su aperta frasca,e con ardente affetto il sole aspetta,fiso guardando pur che l'alba nasca
vid' i' sopra migliaia di lucerne,un sol che tutte quante l'accendea,come fa 'l nostro le viste superne
e per la viva luce trasparea,la lucente sustanza tanto chiara,nel viso mio che non la sostenea
quand' io udi' questa proferta degna,di tanto grato che mai non si stingue,del libro che 'l preterito rassegna
per aiutarmi al millesmo del vero,non si verria cantando il santo riso,e quanto il santo aspetto facea mero
ma chi pensasse il ponderoso tema,e l'omero mortal che se ne carca,nol biasmerebbe se sott' esso trema
il nome del bel fior ch'io sempre invoco,e mane e sera tutto mi ristrinse,l'animo ad avvisar lo maggior foco
per entro il cielo scese una facella,formata in cerchio a guisa di corona,e cinsela e girossi intorno ad ella
e come fantolin che 'nver' la mamma,tende le braccia poi che 'l latte prese,per l'animo che 'nfin di fuor s'infiamma
se per grazia di dio questi preliba,di quel che cade de la vostra mensa,prima che morte tempo li prescriba
ponete mente a l'affezione immensa,e roratelo alquanto: voi bevete,sempre del fonte onde vien quel ch'ei pensa
tenta costui di punti lievi e gravi,come ti piace intorno de la fede,per la qual tu su per lo mare andavi
fede che e,ond' io levai la fronte,in quella luce onde spirava questo
che quell' opere fosser,quel medesmo,che vuol provarsi non altri il ti giura
e io rispondo: io credo in uno dio,solo ed etterno che tutto 'l ciel move,non moto con amore e con disio
come 'l segnor ch'ascolta quel che i piace,da indi abbraccia il servo gratulando,per la novella tosto ch'el si tace
vuol ch'io respiri a te che ti dilette,di lei ed emmi a grato che tu diche,quello che la speranza ti 'mpromette
e come surge e va ed entra in ballo,vergine lieta sol per fare onore,a la novizia non per alcun fallo
con le due stole nel beato chiostro,son le due luci sole che saliro,e questo apporterai nel mondo vostro
non fu latente la santa intenzione,de l'aguglia di cristo anzi m'accorsi,dove volea menar mia professione
con la predetta conoscenza viva,tratto m'hanno del mar de l'amor torto,e del diritto m'han posto a la riva
e come a lume acuto si disonna,per lo spirto visivo che ricorre,a lo splendor che va di gonna in gonna
onde mei che dinanzi vidi poi,e quasi stupefatto domandai,d'un quarto lume ch'io vidi tra noi
quindi onde mosse tua donna virgilio,quattromilia trecento e due volumi,di sol desiderai questo concilio
pria ch'i' scendessi a l'infernale ambascia,i s'appellava in terra il sommo bene,onde vien la letizia che mi fascia
oh gioia,oh ineffabile allegrezza,oh sanza brama sicura ricchezza
e tal ne la sembianza sua divenne,qual diverrebbe iove s'elli e marte,fossero augelli e cambiassersi penne
la provedenza che quivi comparte,vice e officio nel beato coro,silenzio posto avea da ogne parte
quelli ch'usurpa in terra il luogo mio,il luogo mio il luogo mio che vaca,ne la presenza del figliuol di dio
non fu nostra intenzion ch'a destra mano,d'i nostri successor parte sedesse,parte da l'altra del popol cristiano
del sangue nostro caorsini e guaschi,s'apparecchian di bere: o buon principio,a che vil fine convien che tu caschi
fede e innocenza son reperte,solo ne' parvoletti poi ciascuna,pria fugge che le guance sian coperte
poscia che 'ncontro a la vita presente,d'i miseri mortali aperse 'l vero,quella che 'mparadisa la mia mente
come in lo specchio fiamma di doppiero,vede colui che se n'alluma retro,prima che l'abbia in vista o in pensiero
e questo era d'un altro circumcinto,e quel dal terzo e 'l terzo poi dal quarto,dal quinto il quarto e poi dal sesto il quinto
onde se 'l mio disir dee aver fine,in questo miro e angelico templo,che solo amore e luce ha per confine
e poi che le parole sue restaro,non altrimenti ferro disfavilla,che bolle come i cerchi sfavillaro
quelli altri amori che 'ntorno li vonno,si chiaman troni del divino aspetto,per che 'l primo ternaro terminonno
e dei saper che tutti hanno diletto,quanto la sua veduta si profonda,nel vero in che si queta ogne intelletto
quando ambedue li figli di latona,coperti del montone e de la libra,fanno de l'orizzonte insieme zona
forma e materia congiunte e purette,usciro ad esser che non avia fallo,come d'arco tricordo tre saette
concreato fu ordine e costrutto,a le sustanze e quelle furon cima,nel mondo in che puro atto fu produtto
ieronimo vi scrisse lungo tratto,di secoli de li angeli creati,anzi che l'altro mondo fosse fatto
e anche la ragione il vede alquanto,che non concederebbe che ' motori,sanza sua perfezion fosser cotanto
principio del cader fu il maladetto,superbir di colui che tu vedesti,da tutti i pesi del mondo costretto
per che le viste lor furo essaltate,con grazia illuminante e con lor merto,si c'hanno ferma e piena volontate
omai dintorno a questo consistorio,puoi contemplare assai se le parole,mie son ricolte sanz' altro aiutorio
queste sustanze poi che fur gioconde,de la faccia di dio non volser viso,da essa da cui nulla si nasconde
non vi si pensa quanto sangue costa,seminarla nel mondo e quanto piace,chi umilmente con essa s'accosta
per apparer ciascun s'ingegna e face,sue invenzioni e quelle son trascorse,da' predicanti e 'l vangelio si tace
ma tale uccel nel becchetto s'annida,che se 'l vulgo il vedesse vederebbe,la perdonanza di ch'el si confida
per cui tanta stoltezza in terra crebbe,che sanza prova d'alcun testimonio,ad ogne promession si correrebbe
la prima luce che tutta la raia,per tanti modi in essa si recepe,quanti son li splendori a chi s'appaia
vedi l'eccelso omai e la larghezza,de l'etterno valor poscia che tanti,speculi fatti s'ha in che si spezza
quando 'l mezzo del cielo a noi profondo,comincia a farsi tal ch'alcuna stella,perde il parere infino a questo fondo
se quanto infino a qui di lei si dice,fosse conchiuso tutto in una loda,poca sarebbe a fornir questa vice
qui vederai l'una e l'altra milizia,di paradiso e l'una in quelli aspetti,che tu vedrai a l'ultima giustizia
e vidi lume in forma di rivera,fulvido di fulgore intra due rive,dipinte di mirabil primavera
di tal fiumana uscian faville vive,e d'ogne parte si mettien ne' fiori,quasi rubin che oro circunscrive
e' si distende in circular figura,in tanto che la sua circunferenza,sarebbe al sol troppo larga cintura
fassi di raggio tutta sua parvenza,reflesso al sommo del mobile primo,che prende quindi vivere e potenza
la vista mia ne l'ampio e ne l'altezza,non si smarriva ma tutto prendeva,il quanto e 'l quale di quella allegrezza
nel giallo de la rosa sempiterna,che si digrada e dilata e redole,odor di lode al sol che sempre verna
la cieca cupidigia che v'ammalia,simili fatti v'ha al fantolino,che muor per fame e caccia via la balia
in forma dunque di candida rosa,mi si mostrava la milizia santa,che nel suo sangue cristo fece sposa
le facce tutte avean di fiamma viva,e l'ali d'oro e l'altro tanto bianco,che nulla neve a quel termine arriva
quando scendean nel fior di banco in banco,porgevan de la pace e de l'ardore,ch'elli acquistavan ventilando il fianco
di che stupor dovea esser compiuto,certo tra esso e 'l gaudio mi facea,libito non udire e starmi muto
diffuso era per li occhi e per le gene,di benigna letizia in atto pio,quale a tenero padre si convene
di tante cose quant' i' ho vedute,dal tuo podere e da la tua bontate,riconosco la grazia e la virtute
vidi a lor giochi quivi e a lor canti,ridere una bellezza che letizia,era ne li occhi a tutti li altri santi
e s'io avessi in dir tanta divizia,quanta ad imaginar non ardirei,lo minimo tentar di sua delizia
bernardo come vide li occhi miei,nel caldo suo caler fissi e attenti,li suoi con tanto affetto volse a lei
le menti tutte nel suo lieto aspetto,creando a suo piacer di grazia dota,diversamente e qui basti l'effetto
bastavasi ne' secoli recenti,con l'innocenza per aver salute,solamente la fede d'i parenti
poi che le prime etadi fuor compiute,convenne ai maschi a l'innocenti penne,per circuncidere acquistar virtute
io vidi sopra lei tanta allegrezza,piover portata ne le menti sante,create a trasvolar per quella altezza
siede lungh' esso e lungo l'altro posa,quel duca sotto cui visse di manna,la gente ingrata mobile e retrosa
di contr' a pietro vedi sedere anna,tanto contenta di mirar sua figlia,che non move occhio per cantare osanna
e contro al maggior padre di famiglia,siede lucia che mosse la tua donna,quando chinavi a rovinar le ciglia
veramente ne forse tu t'arretri,movendo l'ali tue credendo oltrarti,orando grazia conven che s'impetri
or questi che da l'infima lacuna,de l'universo infin qui ha vedute,le vite spiritali ad una ad una
vinca tua guardia i movimenti umani,vedi beatrice con quanti beati,per li miei prieghi ti chiudon le mani
li occhi da dio diletti e venerati,fissi ne l'orator ne dimostraro,quanto i devoti prieghi le son grati
indi a l'etterno lume s'addrizzaro,nel qual non si dee creder che s'invii,per creatura l'occhio tanto chiaro
da quinci innanzi il mio veder fu maggio,che 'l parlar mostra ch'a tal vista cede,e cede la memoria a tanto oltraggio
o somma luce che tanto ti levi,da' concetti mortali a la mia mente,ripresta un poco di quel che parevi
e fa la lingua mia tanto possente,ch'una favilla sol de la tua gloria,possa lasciare a la futura gente
io credo per l'acume ch'io soffersi,del vivo raggio ch'i' sarei smarrito,se li occhi miei da lui fossero aversi
oh abbondante grazia ond' io presunsi,ficcar lo viso per la luce etterna,tanto che la veduta vi consunsi
ma per la vista che s'avvalorava,in me guardando una sola parvenza,mutandom' io a me si travagliava
ne la profonda e chiara sussistenza,de l'alto lume parvermi tre giri,di tre colori e d'una contenenza
e l'un da l'altro come iri da iri,parea reflesso e 'l terzo parea foco,che quinci e quindi igualmente si spiri
o luce etterna che sola in te sidi,sola t'intendi e da te intelletta,e intendente te ami e arridi
tal era io a quella vista nova,veder voleva come si convenne,l'imago al cerchio e come vi s'indova

satan was now at hand and from his seat,the monster moving onward came as fast,with horrid strides hell trembled as he strode

the stairs were then let down whether to dare,the fiend by easie ascent or aggravate,his sad exclusion from the dores of bliss
such wonder seis'd though after heaven seen,the spirit maligne but much more envy seis'd,at sight of all this world beheld so faire
there lands the fiend a spot like which perhaps,astronomer in the sun's lucent orbe,through his glaz'd optic tube yet never saw
me miserable,which way shall i flie,infinite wrauth and infinite despaire
so saying his proud step he scornful turn'd,but with sly circumspection and began,through wood through waste o're hil o're dale his roam

so scoffing in ambiguous words he scarce,had ended when to right and left the front,divided and to either flank retir'd
this saw his hapless foes but stood obdur'd,and to rebellious fight rallied thir powers,insensate hope conceiving from despair
so spake the son and into terrour chang'd,his count'nance too severe to be beheld,and full of wrauth bent on his enemies

why shouldst not thou like sense within thee feel,when i am present and thy trial choose,with me best witness of thy vertue tri'd
let us not then suspect our happie state,left so imperfet by the maker wise,as not secure to single or combin'd

what fear i then rather what know to feare,under this ignorance of good and evil,of god or death of law or penaltie
to him she hasted in her face excuse,came prologue and apologie to prompt,which with bland words at will she thus addrest
so said he and forbore not glance or toy,of amorous intent well understood,of eve whose eye darted contagious fire
let none henceforth seek needless cause to approve,the faith they owe when earnestly they seek,such proof conclude they then begin to faile
being as i am why didst not thou the head,command me absolutely not to go,going into such danger as thou saidst
to whom sad eve with shame nigh overwhelm'd,confessing soon yet not before her judge,bold or loquacious thus abasht repli'd

god made thee of choice his own and of his own,to serve him thy reward was of his grace,thy punishment then justly is at his will
o conscience into what abyss of fears,and horrors hast thou driv'n me out of which,i find no way from deep to deeper plung'd

she ended heer or vehement despaire,broke off the rest so much of death her thoughts,had entertaind as di'd her cheeks with pale
but adam with such counsel nothing sway'd,to better hopes his more attentive minde,labouring had rais'd and thus to eve repli'd
adam by this from the cold sudden damp,recovering and his scatterd spirits returnd,to michael thus his humble words addressd
o teacher some great mischief hath befall'n,to that meek man who well had sacrific'd,is pietie thus and pure devotion paid
but is there yet no other way besides,these painful passages how we may come,to death and mix with our connatural dust
nor love thy life nor hate but what thou livst,live well how long or short permit to heav'n,and now prepare thee for another sight
o pittie and shame that they who to live well,enterd so faire should turn aside to tread,paths indirect or in the mid way faint
from mans effeminate slackness it begins,said th' angel who should better hold his place,by wisdome and superiour gifts receavd
how comes it thus,unfould celestial guide,and whether here the race of man will end
to teach thee that god attributes to place,no sanctitie if none be thither brought,by men who there frequent or therein dwell
and now the tops of hills as rocks appeer,with clamor thence the rapid currents drive,towards the retreating sea thir furious tyde
he ceas'd discerning adam with such joy,surcharg'd as had like grief bin dew'd in tears,without the vent of words which these he breathd
needs must the serpent now his capital bruise,expect with mortal paine: say where and when,thir fight what stroke shall bruise the victors heel
so spake th' archangel michael then paus'd,as at the worlds great period and our sire,replete with joy and wonder thus repli'd

longer has become the daytime,a pheasant is fluttering,down onto the bridge
slowly passing days,with an echo heard here in a,corner of kyoto
the white elbow,of a priest dozing,in the dusk of spring
into a nobleman,a fox has changed himself,early evening of spring
the light on a candle stand,is transferred to another candle,spring twilight
a short nap,then awakening,this spring day has darkened
who is it for,this pillow on the floor,in the twilight of spring
hazy moonlight,someone is standing,among the pear trees
blossoms on the pear tree,lighten by the moonlight and there,a woman is reading a letter
springtime rain,a little shell on a small beach,enough to moisten it
springtime rain is falling,as a child's rag ball is soaking,wet on the house roof
within the quietness,of a lull in visitors' absence,appears the peony flower
the rain of may,facing toward the big river houses,just two of them
to my eyes how delightful,the fan of my beloved is,in complete white
a flying cuckoo,over the heian capital,goes diagonally across the city
evening breeze,water is slapping against,the legs of a blue heron
an old well,jumping at a mosquito,the fish's sound is dark
young bamboo trees,at hashimoto the courtesan,is she still there or not
after having been fallen,its image still stands,the peony flower
summer night ending so soon,with on the river shallows still remains,the moon in a sliver
it penetrates into me,stepping on the comb of my gone wife,in the bedroom
more than last year,i now feel solitude,this autumn twilight
moon in the sky's top,clearly passes through this,poor town street
let myself go to bed,new year's day is only a matter,for tomorrow
a handsaw is sounding,as if from a poor one,at midnight in this winter
in an old pond,a straw sandal is sinking,it is sleeting
the poems which came from foreign countries,don`t need a visa,just a good translator is enough
o the horseman's and horsewoman's joys,the saddle the gallop the pressure upon the seat the cool gurgling,by the ears and hair
o the joy of the strong-brawn'd fighter towering in the arena in,perfect condition conscious of power thirsting to meet his,opponent
o the joy of that vast elemental sympathy which only the human soul,is capable of generating and emitting in steady and limitless,floods
o the mother's joys,the watching the endurance the precious love the anguish the,patiently yielded life
o the old manhood of me my joy,my children and grand-children my white hair and beard,my largeness calmness majesty out of the long stretch of my life
o the pleasure with trees,the orchard the forest the oak cedar pine pekan-tree,the honey-locust black-walnut cottonwood and magnolia
o while i live to be the ruler of life not a slave,to meet life as a powerful conqueror,no fumes no ennui no more complaints or scornful criticisms
dusk brings,cheeky possums,scampering loudly through the trees
o those feet i cherish,those feet which bring her to me,on tip-toe when days are dark
living is a labor of hope my love,living is a serious business,like loving you
but hope no longer is enough for me,i no longer want to hear the song,i want to sing it
looking in your eyes,i am drunk with the smell of warm earth,lost in a wheat field among the stalks
your eyes,are like an eternal substance changing endlessly,pits without bottom with flashes of green
then the telephone,was closed down,like pitch darkness
and the young girls they say,are taken in the ruins,and in theater loges
that i do feel upon my cheek the glow,of indignation when beneath the rod,a sable brother writhes in silent woe
thus blest we'll live thus wander on our road,and when our grandsons sorrow o'er our tomb,our love to glad their bosoms still shall bloom
but may the god of justice bid the wind,whelm that curst bark beneath the mountain wave,and bless with liberty and death the slave
when he looked the cave in the eye,hercules,had a moment of doubt
leaning out over,the dreadful precipice,one contemptuous tree
to the silver-sanded beaches of the pomeranian shore,and in the town of rambin a little boy and maid,plucked the meadow-flowers together and in the sea-surf played
she will not come she's one of us she's mine,the brown dwarf said,the day is set the cake is baked to-morrow we shall wed
he looked he clasped her in his arms he knew the long-lost one,o lisbeth,see thy playmate  i am the amptman's son
haste,hither bring me precious gems the richest in your store,then when we pass the gate of glass you'll take your cap once more
looked o'er the baltic water to the pomeranian coast,and for his worth ennobled and rich beyond compare,count deitrich and his lovely bride dwelt long and happy there
and flies to a high star,where a distant fire is burning,like a page of the iliad

all the christmases roll down toward the two-tongued sea like a cold and headlong moon bundling down the sky that was our street and they stop at the rim of the ice-edged fish-freezing waves and i plunge my hands in the snow and bring out whatever i can find,in goes my hand into that wool-white bell-tongued ball of holidays resting at the rim of the carol-singing sea and out come mrs,prothero and the firemen

years and years ago when i was a boy when there were wolves in wales and birds the color of red-flannel petticoats whisked past the harp-shaped hills when we sang and wallowed all night and day in caves that smelt like sunday afternoons in damp front farmhouse parlors and we chased with the jawbones of deacons the english and the bears before the motor car before the wheel before the duchess-faced horse when we rode the daft and happy hills bareback it snowed and it snowed,but here a small boy says: it snowed last year too,i made a snowman and my brother knocked it down and i knocked my brother down and then we had tea
no no no in the bat-black snow-white belfries tugged by bishops and storks,and they rang their tidings over the bandaged town over the frozen foam of the powder and ice-cream hills over the crackling sea,it seemed that all the churches boomed for joy under my window and the weathercocks crew for christmas on our fence
get back to the postmen,they were just ordinary postmen found of walking and dogs and christmas and the snow,they knocked on the doors with blue knuckles
get back to the presents,there were the useful presents: engulfing mufflers of the old coach days and mittens made for giant sloths zebra scarfs of a substance like silky gum that could be tug-o'-warred down to the galoshes blinding tam-o'-shanters like patchwork tea cozies and bunny-suited busbies and balaclavas for victims of head-shrinking tribes from aunts who always wore wool next to the skin there were mustached and rasping vests that made you wonder why the aunts had any skin left at all and once i had a little crocheted nose bag from an aunt now alas no longer whinnying with us,and pictureless books in which small boys though warned with quotations not to would skate on farmer giles' pond and did and drowned and books that told me everything about the wasp except why
a form rose strange of mould,that he was hideous hopeless i could feel,rather than could behold
mother exhausted having cooked the lunch,without help as usual,stifles a yawn

so we come down uneasy to look uneasily pacing the beach,these are the dykes our fathers made: we have never known a breach,time and again has the gale blown by and we were not afraid
at the bridge of the lower saltings the cattle gather and blare,roused by the feet of running men dazed by the lantern-glare,where the flood-wash forces the sluices aback and the ditches deliver inland

Force and yielding meet,together: An attack,is half repulsed.
Shafts of broken sunlight,dissolving Convolutions,of torpid cloud.
The boat drifts to,rest Under the outward,spraying branches.
"She is an iris, Dark","purple, pale rose, Under the gnarled boughs That",shatter their stars of bloom.
She waves,delicately With the movement,of the tree.
Of what,is she,dreaming?
Of long nights lit with orange,"lanterns, Of wine cups and compliments and",kisses of the two-sword men.
And of dawn when weary sleepers Lie,"outstretched on the mats of the palace, And of the iris",stalk that is broken in the fountain.
Autumn winds roll through the,dry leaves On her garments; Autumn,birds shiver Athwart star-hung skies.
"Under the blossoming plum-tree, She expresses","the pilgrimage Of grey souls passing, Athwart love's scarlet",maples To the ash-strewn summit of death.
Iris-amid-clouds,Must be,her name.
Tall and lonely,"as the mountain-iris,",Cold and distant.
She has never known,longing: Many have died,for love of her.
""" He listens idly,",He is content,with her voice.
They are spotted with,"thunder showers, Falling upon",the crimson petals.
She is a fierce kitten,leaping in sunlight Towards,the swaying boughs.
"She is a gust of wind, Bending",in parallel curves the boughs,of the willow-tree.
Gilded hummingbirds are whizzing,"Through the palace garden, Deceived by the jade",petals Of the Emperor's jewel-trees.
The wind half blows,"her robes, That subside Listlessly",As swaying pines.
The wind tosses hers In circles,That recoil upon themselves: How should I,love--as the swaying or tossing wind?
She glances expectantly,"Through the pine avenue, To the cherry-tree summit",Where her lover will appear.
Gold and,vermilion The,afternoon.
I wait here dreaming of vermilion,sunsets: In my heart is a half fear,of the chill autumn rain.
The daimyo,and the courtesan Compliment,each other.
He invites her to walk,"out through the maples, She half refuses,",hiding fear in her heart.
She is like the great,rains That fall over the,earth in winter-time.
Gaily he,offers Packets,of merchandise.
He is a harlequin of,"illusions, His nimble features Skip into smiles,","like rainbows, Cheating the villagers."
But in his heart all the while is,"another knowledge, The sorrow of the bleakness",of the long wet winter night.
One life is a long summer; Tall,hollyhocks stand proud upon its paths; Little yellow,"waves of sunlight, Bring scarlet butterflies."
"Another life is a brief autumn, Fierce",storm-rack scrawled with lightning Passed over it Leaving the naked,"bleeding earth, Stabbed with the swords of the rain."
He plots for,"he is angry, He sneers",for he is bold.
He clinches his fist Like a twisted,"snake; Coiling itself, preparing to raise its head, Above",the long grasses of the plain.
I have forgotten how many,"times he kissed me, But I cannot forget A swaying",branch--a leaf that fell To earth.
He stands irresolute,Cloaking the light of,his lantern.
Tonight he will either find,"new love or a sword-thrust, But his soul is",troubled with ghosts of old regret.
Like vines with crimson,flowers They climb Upwards,Into his heart.
"She was a dream of moons, of fluttering handkerchiefs,","Of flying leaves, of parasols, A riddle made to break my heart; The lightest",impulse To her was more dear than the deep-toned temple bell.
She fluttered to my sword-hilt an,"instant, And then flew away; But who will spend",all day chasing a butterfly?
Is it a vision,Under the,moonlight?
"No, it is only",A beautiful geisha,swaying down the street.
"Out of the rings and the bubbles, The curls and the","swirls of the water, Out of the crystalline shower of drops shattered","in play, Her body and her thoughts arose."
Poems are falling from them Swift as the wind,that shakes the lance-like bamboo leaves; The stars close around like bubbles,Stirred by the silver oars of poems passing.
"Beware, for the",dying vine can hold The,strongest oak.
Only by,cutting at the root Can love,be altered.
Late in the night A,rosy glimmer yet defies,the darkness.
"But the evening is growing late, The blinds are",being lowered; She who held your heart and charmed you Is only,a rosy glimmer of flame remembered.
"Rain rattles on the pavement, Puddles",stand in the bluish stones; Afar in the,Yoshiwara Is she who holds my heart.
"Alas, the torn lantern",of my hope Trembles and sputters,in the rain.
I saw him pass at twilight;,He was a dark cloud travelling Over,palace roofs With one claw drooping.
One dainty,"thrust, no more Than","this, he needs."
His heart is like a wind Torn between cloud,and butterfly; Whether he will roll passively to,"one, Or chase endlessly the other."
My heart is broken and mournful,As rain heard beating Far off in the distance,While earth is parched more near.
He only can bow to men Lofty as a god,"To those beneath him, Who has taken sins and sorrows And whose deathless spirit",leaps Beneath them like a golden carp in the torrent.
But the laughing rains,of spring Will break the weak,green shoots of their love.
His will grow a towering,"stalk, Hers, a cowering flower",under it.
Would that the rains,of all the winters Might wash,away my grief!
"The cranes have come back to the temple,","The winds are flapping the flags about, Through a",flute of reeds I will blow a song.
Chrysanthemums,bending Before the,wind.
Chrysanthemums,wavering In the black,choked grasses.
"The wind frowns at them, He",tears off a green and orange stalk,of broken chrysanthemum.
The chrysanthemums spread,"their flattered heads, And scurry",off before the wind.
"Storm-birds of autumn With draggled wings: Sleet-beaten, wind-tattered, snow-frozen, Stopping",in sheer weariness Between the gnarled red pine trees Twisted in doubt and,"despair; Whence do you come, pilgrims, Over what snow fields?"
To what southern province,"Hidden behind dim peaks,",would you go?
"""Too long were the telling Wherefore",we set out; And where we will find rest,Only the Gods may tell.
Only beyond the still grey shoji For the,"breadth of innumerable countries, Is the sea with",ships asleep In the blue-black starless night.
A squall,has struck the sea,afar off.
You can feel it quiver Over the paper,parasol With which she shields her face; In the drawn-together skirts,"of her robes, As she turns to meet it."
"Windy evening of autumn, By the","grey-green swirling river, People are resting like still boats Tugging",uneasily at their cramped chains.
"Some are moving slowly Like the easy winds: Brown-blue,","dull-green, the villages in the distance Sleep on the banks of the river:",The waters sullenly clash and murmur.
The chatter of the,"passersby, Is dulled beneath",the grey unquiet sky.
The green and violet peacocks Through,"the golden dusk Showered upon them from the vine-hung lanterns,","Stately, nostalgically, Parade."
I will scrawl,on the walls of,the night Faces.
"Leering, sneering, scowling, threatening faces;","Weeping, twisting, yelling, howling faces; Faces fixed in a contortion","between a scream and a laugh, Meaningless faces."
I will cover the walls of night With,"faces, Till you do not know If these faces","are but masks, or you the masks for them."
"Faces too grotesque for laughter, Faces","too shattered by pain for tears, Faces of such ugliness",That the ugliness grows beauty.
"They will haunt you morning,","evening, Burning, burning, ever",returning.
"Their own infamy creating,","Till you strike at life and hate it, Burn",your soul up so in hating.
I will scrawl on the,"walls of the night Faces, Pitiless,","Flaring, Staring."
"The seasons passed for her, Like","pale iris wilting, Or peonies flying",to ribbons before the storm-gusts.
The sombre,pine-tops waited until,the seasons had passed.
My beloved is like blue smoke that,"rises In long slow planes, And wavers Over the",dark paths of old gardens long neglected.
"There was a city living here long ago, Of","all that city There is only one stone left half-buried in the marsh, With",characters upon it which no one now can read.
In my heart is,the sorrow Of years like,red leaves buried in snow.
Girls will laugh and scatter,"cherry petals, Sometimes they will rest",in the twisted pine-trees' shade.
If one presses her warm lips to,this tablet The dust of my body will feel a,"thrill, deep down in the silent earth."
The sky spreads out its poor array Of tattered,"flags, Saffron and rose Over the weary huddle of housetops",Smoking their evening pipes in silence.
The city gleams with lights,this evening Like loud and yawning,laughter from red lips.
"As the fish that leaps from the river, As the dropping","of a November leaf at twilight, As the faint flicker of lightning down the","southern sky, So I saw beauty, far away."
I dreamed I caught your loveliness In little,"silver jars: And when you died I opened them, And",there was only soot within.
"Rain fell so softly, in the","evening, I almost thought it was",the trees that were talking.
Cities are the toy-boxes Time plays,with: And there are often many doll-houses,Of which the dolls are lost.
A poet's moods:,Fluttering butterflies,in the rain.
Grass moves in the,"wind, My soul is",backwards blown.
"Land, green-brown; Sea,","brown-grey; Island, dull peacock","blue; Sky, stone-grey."
A bell in the fog Creeps out,echoing faintly The pale broad flashes,"Of vibrating twilight, Faded gold."
There is a goddess who,walks shrouded by day: At night she throws,her blue veil over the earth.
Men only see her,naked glory through the little,holes in the veil.
An old courtyard,Hidden away In the,afternoon.
"Grey walks, Mossy stones, Copper carp swimming","lazily, And beyond, A faint toneless hissing",echo of rain That tears at my heart.
"Here I am, an old man","in a dry month, Being read to","by a boy, waiting for rain."
I was neither at the hot gates Nor,"fought in the warm rain Nor knee deep in the salt marsh,","heaving a cutlass, Bitten by flies, fought."
"My house is a decayed house, And the jew squats on","the window sill, the owner, Spawned in some estaminet of Antwerp,","Blistered in Brussels, patched and peeled in London."
The goat coughs at night,"in the field overhead; Rocks, moss,","stonecrop, iron, merds."
"The woman keeps the kitchen,","makes tea, Sneezes at evening, poking",the peevish gutter.
I an old,"man, A dull head among windy",spaces.
Signs are taken,for,wonders.
"""We would see a sign"": The","word within a word, unable to speak","a word, Swaddled with darkness."
In the juvescence of the year Came Christ the tiger In,"depraved May, dogwood and chestnut, flowering Judas, To be eaten, to be","divided, to be drunk Among whispers; by Mr."
Vacant,shuttles,Weave the wind.
"I have no ghosts, An old",man in a draughty house Under,a windy knob.
After,"such knowledge,",what forgiveness?
Think now History has many cunning,"passages, contrived corridors And issues, deceives with","whispering ambitions, Guides us by vanities."
Think now She gives when our attention is,"distracted And what she gives, gives with such supple confusions",That the giving famishes the craving.
Gives too late What's not believed,"in, or if still believed, In memory","only, reconsidered passion."
"Gives too soon Into weak hands, what's",thought can be dispensed with Till the,refusal propagates a fear.
Think Neither,fear nor courage,saves us.

Are you a beast of,"field and tree, Or just a stronger",child than me?
"O wind, a-blowing all","day long, O wind, that sings",so loud a song!
"I woke before the morning, I","was happy all the day, I never said an ugly","word, but smiled and stuck to play."
And now at last the sun is going,"down behind the wood, And I am very","happy, for I know that I've been good."
"My bed is waiting cool and fresh,","with linen smooth and fair, And I must off to","sleepsin-by, and not forget my prayer."
"I know that, till to-morrow I shall see the","sun arise, No ugly dream shall fright my","mind, no ugly sight my eyes."
"But slumber hold me tightly, till","I waken in the dawn, And hear the thrushes",singing in the lilacs round the lawn.
"Children, you are very little, And","your bones are very brittle; If you would grow great and stately,",You must try to walk sedately.
"You must still be bright and quiet, And content","with simple diet; And remain, through all bewild'ring,",Innocent and honest children.
"Happy hearts and happy faces, Happy","play in grassy places-- That was how, in ancient ages,",Children grew to kings and sages.
"But the unkind and the unruly, And","the sort who eat unduly, They must never hope for",glory-- Theirs is quite a different story!
"Cruel children, crying babies, All grow","up as geese and gabies, Hated, as their age","increases, By their nephews and their nieces."
"Summer fading, winter comes-- Frosty","mornings, tingling thumbs, Window robins, winter","rooks, And the picture story-books."
Water now is turned to stone,Nurse and I can walk upon; Still we find the,flowing brooks In the picture story-books.
All the pretty things put by,"Wait upon the childrens' eye, Sheep and shepherds, trees and","crooks, In the picture story-books."
"We may see how all things are,","Seas and cities, near and far, And the flying fairies'","looks, In the picture story-books."
How am I to sing your,"praise, Happy chimney-corner days, Sitting safe in","nursery nooks, Reading picture story-books?"
How do you like to,"go up in a swing, Up in",the air so blue?
"Oh, I do think it the",pleasantest thing Ever,a child can do!
It is very nice to think The world,is full of meat and drink With little children saying,grace In every Christian kind of place.
The lamps now glitter down the street; Faintly,sound the falling feet And the blue even slowly,falls About the garden trees and walls.
Now in the falling of the gloom The,red fire paints the empty room; And warmly on the roof,"it looks, And flickers on the backs of books."
Armies march by tower and spire Of,"cities blazing, in the fire;-- Till as I gaze with staring","eyes, The armies fade, the lustre dies."
Then once again the glow returns;,Again the phantom city burns; And down,"the red-hot valley, lo!"
The phantom,armies marching,go!
"Blinking embers, tell me true Where are","those armies marching to, And what the burning city",is That crumbles in your furnaces!
Down by a shining water,"well I found a very little dell, No",higher than my head.
The heather and the gorse,"about In summer bloom were coming out,",Some yellow and some red.
I called the little pool a,sea; The little hills were big to me;,For I am very small.
"I made a boat, I made","a town, I searched the caverns up and","down, And named them one and all."
"And all about was mine,","I said, The little sparrows overhead,","The little minnows, too."
This was the world and I was,"king; For me the bees came by to sing,",For me the swallows flew.
I played there were no deeper,"seas, Nor any wider plains than these,",Nor other kings than me.
At last I heard my mother,"call Out from the house at evenfall, To",call me home to tea.
And I must rise and leave,"my dell, And leave my dimpled water well,",And leave my heather blooms.
"and as my home I neared, How","very big my nurse appeared, How",great and cool the rooms!
All round the house is the jet-black night; It,"stares through the window-pane; It crawls in the corners, hiding from the","light, And it moves with the moving flame."
"Now my little heart goes a-beating like a drum, With","the breath of Bogie in my hair, And all round the candle the crooked","shadows come, And go marching along up the stair."
"The shadow of the balusters, the shadow of the","lamp, The shadow of the child that goes to bed-- All the wicked shadows","coming, tramp, tramp, tramp, With the black night overhead."
"Late lies the wintry sun a-bed, A frosty,",fiery sleepy-head; Blinks but an hour or two;,"and then, A blood-red orange, sets again."
"Before the stars have left the skies, At",morning in the dark I rise; And shivering in my,"nakedness, By the cold candle, bathe and dress."
Close by the jolly fire I sit,"To warm my frozen bones a bit; Or with a reindeer-sled,",explore The colder countries round the door.
"When to go out, my nurse doth wrap Me in",my comforter and cap; The cold wind burns my face and,blows Its frosty pepper up my nose.
Black are my steps on silver sod; Thick blows,"my frosty breath abroad; And tree and house, and hill","and lake, Are frosted like a wedding-cake."
I can in the,sorrel sit Where the,ladybird alit.
I can climb the jointed grass; And on high,"See the greater swallows pass In the sky, And the round sun",rolling by Heeding no such things as I.
"Through that forest I can pass Till, as in a","looking-glass, Humming fly and daisy tree And my tiny self I see, Painted",very clear and neat On the rain-pool at my feet.
Should a leaflet come to land Drifting,"near to where I stand, Straight I'll board that tiny",boat Round the rain-pool sea to float.
Little thoughtful creatures sit On,the grassy coasts of it; Little things with lovely,eyes See me sailing with surprise.
Some are clad in armour,green-- (These have sure to battle,been!
")-- Some are pied with ev'ry hue, Black","and crimson, gold and blue; Some have wings and swift are",gone; But they all look kindly on.
"Last, to the chamber where I lie My","fearful footsteps patter nigh, And come from out the cold and",gloom Into my warm and cheerful room.
"There, safe arrived, we turn about To keep","the coming shadows out, And close the happy door at",last On all the perils that we passed.
"Then, when mamma goes by to bed, She shall","come in with tip-toe tread, And see me lying warm and",fast And in the Land of Nod at last.
"When the golden day is done, Through","the closing portal, Child and garden, flower","and sun, Vanish all things mortal."
"As the blinding showers fall,","As the rays diminish, Under evening's cloak they",all Roll away and vanish.
"Garden darkened, daisy shut,","Child in bed, they slumber-- Glow-worm in the highway","rut, Mice among the lumber."
"In the darkness houses shine, Parents","move with candles Till on all, the night divine",Turns the bedroom handles.
Till at last the day begins,"In the east a-breaking, In the hedges and",the whins Sleeping birds a-waking.
"In the darkness shapes of things, Houses,","trees and hedges, Clearer grow; and sparrow's",wings Beat on window ledges.
"These shall wake the yawning maid,",She the door shall open-- Finding dew on garden,glade And the morning broken.
There my garden grows again Green and,"rosy painted, As at eve behind the",pane From my eyes it fainted.
"Just as it was shut away,","Toy-like, in the even, Here I see it glow with",day Under glowing heaven.
Every path and every,"plot, Every bush of roses, Every",blue forget-me-not Where the dew reposes.
"they cry, 'the day is come On the",smiling valleys; We have beat the morning,"drum; Playmate, join your allies!"
 Birds all the sunny day Flutter,and quarrel Here in the arbor-like,Tent of the laurel.
Here in the fork The brown,nest is seated; Four little blue eggs,The mother keeps heated.
"While we stand watching her, Staring","like gabies, Safe in each egg are the",Bird's little babies.
"Soon the frail eggs they shall Chip,",and upspringing Make all the April,woods Merry with singing.
"Younger than we are, O children,","and frailer, Soon in blue air they'll be,",Singer and sailor.
"We, so much older, Taller","and stronger, We shall look down on",the Birdies no longer.
They shall go flying With,musical speeches High over head in,the Tops of the beeches.
In spite of our wisdom,"And sensible talking, We on our feet",must go Plodding and walking.
All the names I know from nurse:,"Gardener's garters, Shepherd's purse, Bachelor's","buttons, Lady's smock, And the Lady Hollyhock."
"Fairy places, fairy things, Fairy","woods where the wild bee wings, Tiny trees for tiny",dames-- These must all be fairy names!
Tiny woods below whose boughs Shady,"fairies weave a house; Tiny tree-tops, rose or thyme, Where",the braver fairies climb!
"Fair are grown-up people's trees, But the","fairest woods are these; Where if I were not so tall,",I should live for good and all.
"Here is a child who clambers and scrambles, All",by himself and gathering brambles; Here is a tramp who stands and gazes;,And there is the green for stringing the daisies!
Here is a cart run away in the road Lumping,along with man and load; And here is a mill and there is a,"river, Each a glimpse and gone forever!"
This whistle,we made (and how clearly,it sounds!
) By the side of a,field at the end,of the grounds.
"Of a branch of a plane, with a","knife of my own, It was nursie who","made it, and nursie alone!"
What are you,able to build,with your blocks?
Castles and,"palaces, temples",and docks.
Rain may keep raining and others,"go roam, But I can be happy",and building at home.
This one is sailing and,that one is moored: Hark to the song,of the sailors on board!
And see the steps of my,"palace, the kings Coming and going",with presents and things!
Now I have,"done with it, down",let it go!
All in,a moment the town,is laid low.
Block upon block lying,"scattered and free, What is there left of",my town by the sea?
"The gardener does not love to talk, He makes","me keep the gravel walk; And when he puts his tools away,",He locks the door and takes the key.
Away behind the currant row Where,"no one else but cook may go, Far in the plots, I see","him dig, Old and serious, brown and big."
"He digs the flowers,","green, red and blue, Nor wishes",to be spoken to.
He digs the flowers,"and cuts the hay, And never",seems to want to play.
"summer goes, And winter comes","with pinching toes, When in the garden bare",and brown You must lay your barrow down.

Song of a tribe of the ancient,Egyptians (The Priests within the Temple) She was wrinkled,and huge and hideous?
She,was our,Mother.
She was,lustful and,lewd?
-- but a,God; we had none,other.
"In the day She was hidden and dumb,",but at nightfall moaned in the shade; We shuddered and gave,Her Her will in the darkness; we were afraid.
(The People without) She sent us,"pain, And we bowed before Her; She smiled",again And bade us adore Her.
She solaced our woe,And soothed our sighing; And what,shall we do Now God is dying?
(The Priests within) She was,hungry and ate our children;,-- how should we stay Her?
She took our young,men and our maidens; -- ours,to obey Her.
We were loathed and mocked,and reviled of all nations;,that was our pride.
"She fed us, protected","us, loved us, and killed",us; now She has died.
(The People without),She was so strong; But death,is stronger.
She ruled,us long; But Time,is longer.

"They'll call the news from hill to hill,","Dark and uncomforted, Earth and sky and the winds;",and I Shall know that you are dead.
"I shall not hear your trentals, Nor eat",your arval bread; For the kin of you will surely,do Their duty by the dead.
Their little dull greasy,"eyes will water; They'll paw you,",and gulp afresh.
They'll sniffle and,"weep, and their thoughts will creep Like",flies on the cold flesh.
"They will put pence on your grey eyes,","Bind up your fallen chin, And lay you straight, the fools",that loved you Because they were your kin.

"I shall not hear your trentals, Nor","eat your arval bread, Nor with smug breath tell lies of",death To the unanswering dead.
With snuffle and sniff and,"handkerchief, The folk who loved you not Will bury","you, and go wondering Back home."
And,you will,rot.
"But laughing and half-way up to heaven,","With wind and hill and star, I yet shall keep, before","I sleep, Your Ambarvalia."
There was a damned,successful Poet; There was,a Woman like the Sun.
And,they,were dead.
They,did not know,it.
They did not,know their time,was done.
They did not know his hymns Were,"silence; and her limbs, That had served Love so","well, Dust, and a filthy smell."
So knee to knee they sped,"again, And laugh to laugh they ran, I'm","told, Across the streets of Hell ."
And then They suddenly felt the wind blow,"cold, And knew, so closely pressed, Chill air on lip and breast, And,","with a sick surprise, The emptiness of eyes."
"Here, where love's stuff is","body, arm and side Are stabbing-sweet",gainst chair and lamp and wall.
In every touch more,intimate meanings hide; And flaming,brains are the white heart of all.
"Here, million pulses to one centre beat: Closed in by","men's vast friendliness, alone, Two can be drunk with solitude, and",meet On the sheer point where sense with knowing's one.
"though the woods are quiet,",and you've heard Night creep along,the hedges.
Never go Where tangled,"foliage shrouds the crying bird, And the","remote winds sigh, and waters flow!"
For moveless limbs no,"pity I crave, That",never were swift!
"Still all I prize, Laughter and thought and friends,",I have; No fool to heave luxurious sighs For,the woods and hills that I never knew.
The more,excellent,way's yet mine!
And you Flower-laden come to,"the clean white cell, And we talk as ever",-- am I not the same?
"With our hearts we love,","immutable, You without","pity, I without shame."
We talk as of old; as of old you go Out,"under the sky, and laughing, I know, Flit through the streets, your heart all",me; Till you gain the world beyond the town.
Then -- I fade from your,"heart, quietly; And your",fleet steps quicken.
The strong down Smiles you welcome there;,the woods that love you Close lovely and,conquering arms above you.
"O ever-moving,",O lithe,and free!
Fast in my linen prison I press,"On impassable bars, or emptily",Laugh in my great loneliness.
And still in the white neat bed I strive Most,"impotently against that gyve; Being less now than a thought, even,",To you alone with your hills and heaven.
I Hot through Troy's ruin Menelaus,"broke To Priam's palace, sword in hand, to sate On that adulterous",whore a ten years' hate And a king's honour.
"Through red death, and smoke, And cries, and then","by quieter ways he strode, Till the still",innermost chamber fronted him.
"He swung his sword, and crashed into","the dim Luxurious bower,",flaming like a god.
High sat white,"Helen, lonely",and serene.
He had not remembered that she,"was so fair, And that her neck curved down in such",a way; And he felt tired.
"He flung the sword away, And","kissed her feet, and knelt before her there, The",perfect Knight before the perfect Queen.
II So,far the,poet.
How should he behold,"That journey home, the long",connubial years?
He does not tell you how white Helen,"bears Child on legitimate child, becomes","a scold, Haggard with virtue."
Menelaus bold,"Waxed garrulous, and sacked a hundred",Troys 'Twixt noon and supper.
And her golden,voice Got shrill as he,grew deafer.
And,both,were old.
Often he wonders,"why on earth he went Troyward, or why",poor Paris ever came.
"Oft she weeps, gummy-eyed",and impotent; Her dry shanks twitch,at Paris' mumbled name.
So Menelaus nagged;,and Helen cried; And Paris slept on,by Scamander side.
How should,I,know?
The enormous wheels,of will Drove me cold-eyed on tired,and sleepless feet.
Night was void arms and,"you a phantom still, And day your far",light swaying down the street.
As never fool for,"love, I starved for you; My throat was dry and",my eyes hot to see.
Your mouth so lying was most,"heaven in view, And your remembered",smell most agony.
I felt your hot wrist shiver,And suddenly the mad victory I planned Flashed,"real, in your burning bending head."
My conqueror's blood was cool as a deep,river In shadow; and my heart beneath your hand,Quieter than a dead man on a bed.
Day after day you'll sit with him and note The,"greasier tie, the dingy wrinkling coat; As prettiness turns to","pomp, and strength to fat, And love, love, love to habit!"
"O lithe and free And lightfoot,","that the poor heart cries to see, That's how",I'll see your man and you!
"-- But you -- Oh, when","THAT time comes, you'll",be dirty too!
"My restless blood now lies a-quiver, Knowing that","always, exquisitely, This April twilight on the river",Stirs anguish in the heart of me.
"And all these, like a waiting lover,","Murmur and gleam, lift lustrous eyes, Drift close to me, and",sideways bending Whisper delicious words.
But I Stretch terrible,"hands, uncomprehending, Shaken with",love; and laugh; and cry.
And Hatred followed,"after, Shrilling madly",down the breeze.
"In peace from the wild heart of clamour, A","flower in moonlight, she was there, Was rippling down white ways",of glamour Quietly laid on wave and air.
Her passing,left no,leaf a-quiver.
Pale flowers,"wreathed her white,",white brows.
Her feet were,silence on the,"river; And ""Hush!"
""" she","said, between",the boughs.
In darkness the loud sea,"makes moan; And earth is shaken, and all evils",creep About her ways.
"Oh, now",to know you,sleep!
Your magic and your beauty and,"your strength, Like hills at noon or sunlight on a","tree, Sleeping prevail in earth and air."
In the sweet gloom above the brown and white,Night benedictions hover; and the winds of night Move,"gently round the room, and watch you there."
And still,the darkness ebbs about,your bed.
"Quiet, and","strange, and loving-kind,",you sleep.
And holy joy about,the earth is shed; And holiness,upon the deep.
"From the candles and dumb shadows,","And the house where love had died, I stole to the vast moonlight",And the whispering life outside.
"But I found no lips of comfort, No home","in the moon's light (I, little and lone and frightened In the unfriendly","night), And no meaning in the voices."
Far over the lands and,"through The dark, beyond the ocean, I",willed to think of YOU!
"For I knew, had you been with me I'd","have known the words of night, Found peace of heart, gone",gladly In comfort of that light.
But ever Desperately,I willed; Till all grew soft and,far And silent .
And suddenly I found you,"white and radiant, Sleeping quietly,",Far out through the tides of darkness.
"Love,"" they said,","""is King of Kings, And Triumph",is his crown.
Earth fades in flame before,"his wings, And Sun and",Moon bow down.
""" -- But that, I knew, would",never do; And Heaven,is all too high.
So whenever I,"meet a Queen, I said, I will",not catch her eye.
"Love,"" they said, and ""Love,"" they said, ""The gift",of Love is this; A crown of thorns about thy,"head, And vinegar to thy kiss!"
""" -- But Tragedy",is not for me; And I'm content,to be gay.
So whenever I,"spied a Tragic Lady, I",went another way.
And so I never feared to see,"You wander down the street, Or come across the",fields to me On ordinary feet.
"For what they'd never told me of,",And what I never knew; It was that all the,"time, my love, Love would be merely you."
Safe in the magic,"of my woods I lay, and watched",the dying light.
"Faint in the pale high solitudes,","And washed with rain and veiled by night, Silver",and blue and green were showing.
"The spell was broken, the key denied",me And at length your flat clear voice beside me,Mouthed cheerful clear flat platitudes.
You came and,quacked beside me,in the wood.
"You said, ""The",view from here is,very good!
""" You said, ""It's",nice to be alone,a bit!
""" And, ""How",the days are,drawing out!
"You said,","""The sunset's pretty, isn't",it?
I wish,-- I wish that you,were dead!
"Lip and eye Flashed on the glory, shone and","cried, Improvident, unmemoried; And fitfully and like",a flame The light of laughter went and came.
Proud in their careless,transience moved The changing,faces that I loved.
"Till suddenly, and","otherwhence, I looked upon",your innocence.
For lifted clear and still and strange From,the dark woven flow of change Under a vast and starless sky,I saw the immortal moment lie.
"One instant I,","an instant, knew",As God knows all.
And it,"and you I, above","Time, oh, blind!"
could see,In witless,immortality.
"I saw the marble cup; the tea, Hung on","the air, an amber stream; I saw the fire's unglittering","gleam, The painted flame, the frozen smoke."
Light was more,alive,than you.
"For suddenly, and","otherwhence, I looked on your",magnificence.
Dazed at length Human,"eyes grew, mortal strength Wearied; and",Time began to creep.
Change closed,about me,like a sleep.
Light glinted,on the eyes,I loved.
The cup,was,filled.
The,bodies,moved.
The drifting,petal came,to ground.
The laughter,chimed its perfect,round.
The broken,syllable,was ended.
"And I, so certain and so","friended, How could I cloud, or how distress, The heaven",of your unconsciousness?
Or shake at Time's,"sufficient spell, Stammering",of lights unutterable?
The eternal holiness,"of you, The timeless end, you never knew,","The peace that lay, the light that shone."
You never knew that,I had gone A million miles,"away, and stayed A million years."
The laughter played,Unbroken round me;,and the jest Flashed on.
And we that knew the,best Down wonderful hours,grew happier yet.
"I sang at heart, and talked, and","eat, And lived from laugh to laugh, I too,","When you were there, and you, and you."
In a flowered dell,"the Lady Venus stood,",Amazed with sorrow.
Down the morning one Far golden,horn in the gold of trees and sun Rang,out; and held; and died.
She thought the,wood Grew,quieter.
"Wing, and leaf,",and pool of light,Forgot to dance.
Dumb lay the unfalling stream;,Life one eternal instant rose in dream Clear out,"of time, poised on a golden height."
Till a swift,terror broke the,abrupt hour.
The gold waves purled,amidst the green above her;,And a bird sang.
"With one sharp-taken breath, By sunlit branches and","unshaken flower, The immortal limbs flashed to the human lover,",And the immortal eyes to look on death.
The damned,ship lurched,and slithered.
Quiet and quick My cold gorge rose; the long,"sea rolled; I knew I must think hard of something, or be sick;",And could think hard of only one thing -- YOU!
"You, you alone",could hold my fancy,ever!
And with you,"memories come,","sharp pain, and dole."
Now there's a,choice -- heartache or,tortured liver!
"A sea-sick body,",or a you-sick,soul!
Do I,forget,you?
Retchings twist and tie,"me, Old meat, good meals, brown","gobbets, up I throw."
Acrid return and,"slimy, The sobs and slobber",of a last years woe.
And still,the sick ship,rolls.
"Tis hard, I tell ye,","To choose 'twixt love and nausea,",heart and belly.
All night the ways of Heaven,"were desolate, Long roads across a",gleaming empty sky.
"Outcast and doomed and driven, you and I,","Alone, serene beyond all love or hate, Terror or triumph,","were content to wait, We, silent and all-knowing."
Suddenly Swept through the heaven,"low-crouching from on high, One horseman, downward",to the earth's low gate.
"Oh, perfect from the ultimate","height of living, Lightly we turned, through wet woods","blossom-hung, Into the open."
"Down the supernal roads, With plumes a-tossing, purple","flags far flung, Rank upon rank, unbridled, unforgiving,",Thundered the black battalions of the Gods.
Through my heart's palace Thoughts unnumbered,"throng; And there, most quiet and, as a child, most wise,","High-throned you sit, and gracious."
"All day long Great Hopes gold-armoured, jester","Fantasies, And pilgrim Dreams, and little beggar","Sighs, Bow to your benediction, go their way."
And the grave jewelled,courtier Memories Worship and,"love and tend you, all the day."
"not now, when desire burns, and the","wind calls, and the suns of spring Light-foot dance in the woods,","whisper of life, woo me to wayfaring; Ah!"
"not now should you come, now when the road","beckons, and good friends call, Where are songs to","be sung, fights to be fought, yea!"
"and the best of all, Love,",on myriad lips fairer than,"yours, kisses you could not give!"
"Dearest, why should I","mourn, whimper, and whine, I",that have yet to live?
"Sorrow will I forget, tears for the best, love on","the lips of you, Now, when dawn in the blood wakes, and the sun laughs",up the eastern blue; I'll forget and be glad!
Still I abode strong,"in a golden dream,",Unrecaptured.
"and, in the","heart of it, End of","labouring, you!"
Therefore I kept,"ready the altar, lit","The flame, burning apart."
Face of my dreams,vainly in vision white Gleaming,"down to me, lo!"
For about midnight Whispers,"grew through the wood suddenly, strange cries in the","boughs above Grated, cries like a laugh."
Silent and black then through the,"sacred grove Great birds flew, as a dream,","troubling the leaves, passing at length."
Therefore I go; never to,"rest, or win Peace, and worship of you more, and the",dumb wood and the shrine therein.
"So light we were, so right we were, so","fair faith shone, And the way was laid so certainly, that, when","I'd gone, What dumb thing looked up at you?"
"Was it something heard, Or a sudden","cry, that meekly and without a word You broke the","faith, and strangely, weakly, slipped apart."
You gave in,"-- you, the proud of heart, unbowed",of heart!
"Was this, friend,",the end of all that,we could do?
And have you found,"the best for you,",the rest for you?
Did you learn,so suddenly,(and I not by!
") Some whispered story, that stole the glory from","the sky, And ended all the splendid dream, and made you go So","dully from the fight we know, the light we know?"
"the faith remains, and",I must pass Gay down the,"way, and on alone."
Under the grass You wait; the breeze,"moves in the trees, and stirs, and calls, And covers you","with white petals, with light petals."
Good,sleep to,you!
We have built,a house that is not for,Time's throwing.
We have gained a,peace unshaken by,pain for ever.
War,knows no,power.
"Safe shall be my going, Secretly armed against",all death's endeavour; Safe though all safety's lost; safe where men fall;,"And if these poor limbs die, safest of all."
"Blow out, you","bugles, over the",rich Dead!
There's none of these so lonely,"and poor of old, But, dying, has made us",rarer gifts than gold.
"Blow,","bugles,",blow!
"They brought us, for","our dearth, Holiness, lacked","so long, and Love, and Pain."
"Honour has come back, as a king, to earth, And",paid his subjects with a royal wage; And Nobleness walks in our,ways again; And we have come into our heritage.
These hearts were woven of,"human joys and cares, Washed marvellously","with sorrow, swift to mirth."
The years,had given them,kindness.
"Dawn was theirs,","And sunset, and the colours",of the earth.
"These had seen movement, and heard music; known Slumber",and waking; loved; gone proudly friended; Felt the quick stir of wonder;,sat alone; Touched flowers and furs and cheeks.
All,this is,ended.
There are waters blown,by changing winds to laughter And,"lit by the rich skies, all day."
"And after, Frost, with a","gesture, stays the waves that dance And",wandering loveliness.
"He leaves a white Unbroken glory,","a gathered radiance, A width, a","shining peace, under the night."
"If I should die, think only",this of me: That there's some corner of a foreign,field That is for ever England.
"Mamua, when our laughter ends, And","hearts and bodies, brown as white, Are dust about the doors of","friends, Or scent ablowing down the night, Then, oh!"
"then, the wise agree,",Comes our,immortality.
"Mamua, there",waits a land Hard for us,to understand.
"Out of time, beyond the sun, All","are one in Paradise, You and Pupure are","one, And Tau, and the ungainly wise."
"And my laughter, and","my pain, Shall home to the",Eternal Brain.
And there'll no more be one who dreams,"Under the ferns, of crumbling stuff, Eyes of illusion,","mouth that seems, All time-entangled human love."
And you'll no longer swing and sway,"Divinely down the scented shade, Where feet to Ambulation","fade, And moons are lost in endless Day."
How shall we wind these,"wreaths of ours, Where there are",neither heads nor flowers?
"-- but we'll be missing The palms, and sunlight,","and the south; And there's an end, I think, of kissing,",When our mouths are one with Mouth.
"Tau here',","Mamua, Crown the","hair, and come away!"
Hear the calling of the,"moon, And the whispering scents that stray About",the idle warm lagoon.
"Hasten, hand in human hand, Down the dark, the flowered","way, Along the whiteness of the sand, And in the water's soft caress, Wash the","mind of foolishness, Mamua, until the day."
Spend the glittering moonlight there,Pursuing down the soundless deep Limbs that gleam and,"shadowy hair, Or floating lazy, half-asleep."
"Dive and double and follow after, Snare in flowers,","and kiss, and call, With lips that fade, and human laughter And faces","individual, Well this side of Paradise!"
There's little,comfort in,the wise.
"Love, in you, went passing by, Penetrative,","remote, and rare, Like a bird in the wide air, And, as the bird,",it left no trace In the heaven of your face.
In your stupidity,I found The sweet hush after,a sweet sound.
All about you was the light That dims the greying end,"of night; Desire was the unrisen sun, Joy the day not yet begun, With","tree whispering to tree, Without wind, quietly."
"Wisdom slept within your hair, And Long-Suffering","was there, And, in the flowing of your dress,",Undiscerning Tenderness.
"And when you thought, it seemed to me,","Infinitely, and like a sea, About the slight world you",had known Your vast unconsciousness was thrown.
O haven,without wave or,tide!
"Silence,",in which all songs,have died!
Holy,"book, where",hearts are still!
And home,at length under,the hill!
"O mother quiet,","breasts of peace, Where love itself",would faint and cease!
"Now, ere the unthinking silence on that strife Steals","down, I would cheat drowsy Death so far, My night shall be remembered",for a star That outshone all the suns of all men's days.
Shall I not crown them with immortal praise Whom I,"have loved, who have given me, dared with me High secrets, and in darkness",knelt to see The inenarrable godhead of delight?
Love is a,flame; -- we have beaconed,the world's night.
A city:,"-- and we have built it,",these and I.
An emperor:,-- we have taught the,world to die.
"Dear names, And",thousand other,throng to me!
"And these shall pass, Whatever passes not,","in the great hour, Nor all my passion, all my prayers,",have power To hold them with me through the gate of Death.
"They'll play deserter, turn with the traitor","breath, Break the high bond we made, and sell Love's trust And sacramented",covenant to the dust.
"But the best I've known, Stays here, and changes,","breaks, grows old, is blown About the winds of the world, and fades","from brains Of living men, and dies."
"O dear my loves, O faithless, once again This","one last gift I give:  that after men Shall know, and later lovers,","far-removed, Praise you, ""All these were lovely""; say, ""He loved."

I had rest Unhoped,"this side of Heaven, beneath",your breast.

"Waikiki, October 1913",Today I have been,happy.
"The Pacific, October 1913 Warm",perfumes like a breath from vine and tree Drift down the,darkness.
"Plangent, hidden from eyes Somewhere",an 'eukaleli' thrills and cries And stabs with pain,the night's brown savagery.
"And dark scents whisper; and dim waves creep to me, Gleam like","a woman's hair, stretch out, and rise; And new stars burn into the ancient","skies, Over the murmurous soft Hawaian sea."

There the sure suns of these pale shadows move; There stand,the immortal ensigns of our war; Our melting flesh fixed Beauty,"there, a star, And perishing hearts, imperishable Love."
"Dear, we know only that we sigh, kiss,",smile; Each kiss lasts but the kissing; and grief goes over;,Love has no habitation but the heart.

Thank,"God,",that's done!

And I,daresay she,will do.
I came back late and tired last,"night Into my little room, To the long chair and the",firelight And comfortable gloom.
I stood a moment,"fierce and still, Watching",her neck and hair.
I made a step,to her; and saw That there,was no one there.
It was some trick of,the firelight That made,me see her there.
It was a chance,of shade and light And the,cushion in the chair.
"Oh, all you happy","over the earth, That night,",how could I sleep?
I lay and watched the lonely gloom;,"And watched the moonlight creep From wall to basin,","round the room, All night I could not sleep."
Hands and lit faces,eddy to a line; The dazed last minutes,click; the clamour dies.
"Beyond the great-swung arc o' the roof, divine,","Night, smoky-scarv'd, with thousand coloured eyes Glares the",imperious mystery of the way.
"Thirsty for dark, you feel the long-limbed","train Throb, stretch, thrill motion, slide, pull out and sway, Strain","for the far, pause, draw to strength again."
-- There is an,"end appointed, O",my soul!
Crimson and green the,signals burn; the gloom Is hung with steam's,far-blowing livid streamers.
"Lost into God, as lights","in light, we fly, Grown one with","will, end-drunken huddled dreamers."
The white,lights,roar.
The,sounds of the,world die.
And lips and,laughter are,forgotten things.
Speed,sharpens;,grows.
"Into the night, and","on, The strength and splendour of",our purpose swings.
The,lamps fade; and,the stars.
We,are,alone.
"All suddenly the wind comes soft, And",Spring is here again; And the hawthorn quickens,"with buds of green, And my heart with buds of pain."
"My heart all Winter lay so numb,","The earth so dead and frore, That I never thought the","Spring would come, Or my heart wake any more."
"But Winter's broken and earth has woken, And",the small birds cry again; And the hawthorn hedge puts forth,"its buds, And my heart puts forth its pain."
They queerly find some healing,"so, And strange attainment in the touch; There is a secret","lovers know, -- I have read as much."
"And theirs no longer joy nor smart,","Changing or ending, night or day; But mouth to mouth,","and heart on heart, -- So lovers say."
"Young Mary, loitering once her","garden way, Felt a warm splendour grow in the April","day, As wine that blushes water through."

"There is singing of birds in the deep wet woods,","In the heart of the listening solitudes, Pewees, and thrushes, and sparrows,","not few, And all the notes of their throats are true."

Grief was my master yesternight;,To-morrow I may grieve again; But now along the,windy plain The clouds have taken flight.
The roads far off are towered with dust;,The cherry-blooms are swept and thinned; In yonder swaying elms,the wind Is charging gust on gust.
But here there is no stir at all; The,ministers of sun and shadow Horde all the perfumes of,the meadow Behind a grassy wall.
An infant rivulet wind-free Adown,"the guarded hollow sets, Over whose brink the violets",Are nodding peacefully.
From pool to pool it prattles by; The,"flashing swallows dip and pass, Above the tufted marish","grass, And here at rest am I."
"I care not for the old distress,","Nor if to-morrow bid me moan; To-day is mine, and I",have known An hour of blessedness.
"I passed through the gates of the city, The","streets were strange and still, Through the doors of the open",churches The organs were moaning shrill.
I strayed through the midst,of the city Like one,distracted or mad.
""" I kept saying,",And the very,word seemed sad.
"I passed through the gates of the city,","And I heard the small birds sing, I laid me down",in the meadows Afar from the bell-ringing.
In the depth and the bloom of the meadows,"I lay on the earth's quiet breast, The poplar fanned me with shadows,",And the veery sang me to rest.
"Blue, blue was the heaven","above me, And the earth green","at my feet; ""Oh, Life!"
""" I kept saying,",And the very,word seemed sweet.
High in the hills the solitary thrush Tunes magically,"his music of fine dreams, In briary dells, by boulder-broken streams; And wide and far",on nebulous fields aflush The mellow morning gleams.
"The orange cone-flowers purple-bossed are there, The meadow's bold-eyed","gypsies deep of hue, And slender hawkweed tall and softly fair,",And rosy tops of fleabane veiled with dew.
Dim surging motions and uneasy dreads Scare the light,"slumber from men's busy eyes, And parted lovers on their restless","beds Toss and yearn out, and cannot sleep for sighs."
"Ah,",the,distance!
Blue,and broad and,dim!
Peace is not in,"burgh or meadow, But",beyond the rim.
"Aye, beyond it, far beyond it; Follow","still my soul, Till this earth is lost in heaven,",And thou feel'st the whole.
"And yet a moment more, Out of the silent wood,",As if from the closing door Of another world and another,"lovelier mood, Hear'st thou the hermit pour-- So sweet!"
-- His golden,"music, ghostly",beautiful.
"But when the fourth day came--at noon, The darkness and",the rain were by; The sunward roofs were steaming dry; And all the world,was flecked and strewn With shadows from a fleecy sky.
The haymakers were,"forth and gone, And every",rillet laughed and shone.
"With a turn of his magical rod,","That extended and suddenly shone, From the round of his",glory some god Looks forth and is gone.
To the summit of heaven the clouds,Are rolling aloft like steam; There's a break in their,"infinite shrouds, And below it a gleam."
O'er the drift of the river a whiff,"Comes out from the blossoming shore; And the meadows are greening,",as if They never were green before.
The islands are kindled with gold And,russet and emerald dye; And the interval,waters outrolled Are more blue than the sky.
From my feet to the heart of the hills The,"spirits of May intervene, And a vapor of azure",distills Like a breath on the opaline green.
--and then The chill and the shadow,"decline, On the eyes of rejuvenate",men That were wide and divine.
"The full, clear moon uprose and spread Her","cold, pale splendor o'er the sea; A light-strewn path that seemed to",lead Outward into eternity.
Between the darkness and the gleam An,old-world spell encompassed me: Methought that in a godlike,dream I trod upon the sea.
"What would'st thou have for easement after grief, When","the rude world hath used thee with despite, And care sits at thine elbow","day and night, Filching thy pleasures like a subtle thief?"
On such a day the shrunken stream Spends,its last water and runs dry; Clouds like far turrets in a,dream Stand baseless in the burning sky.
On such a day at every rod,"The toilers in the hay-field halt, With dripping brows, and",the parched sod Yields to the crushing foot like salt.
I watch the swinging currents go Far,"down to where, enclosed and piled, The logs crowd, and the Gatineau",Comes rushing from the northern wild.
"I see the long low point, where close The shore-lines,","and the waters end, I watch the barges pass in rows",That vanish at the tapering bend.
"I see no more the barges pass, Nor","mark the ripple round the pier, And all the uproar, mass","on mass, Falls dead upon a vacant ear."
"Beyond the tumult of the mills, And all","the city's sound and strife, Beyond the waste, beyond the","hills, I look far out and dream of life."
"Around the long low shanties, whose rough lines Break","the sealed dreams of many an unnamed lake, Already in the frost-clear",morns awake The crash and thunder of the falling pines.
"With what doubting eyes, oh sparrow,","Thou regardest me, Underneath yon spray of","yarrow, Dipping cautiously."
"Fear me not, oh little sparrow,","Bathe and never fear, For to me both pool and",yarrow And thyself are dear.
And on beside,the river's sober edge A long,fresh field lies black.
"Beyond, Low thickets gray and reddish stand,","Stroked white with birch; and near at hand, Over a little steel-smooth pond,",Hang multitudes of thin and withering sedge.
Across a waste and solitary rise A,"ploughman urges his dull team, A stooped gray figure with prone brow That","plunges bending to the plough With strong, uneven steps."
The stream Rings and,re-echoes with his,furious cries.
"Sometimes the lowing of a cow,","long-drawn, Comes from far off; and crows in strings Pass",on the upper silences.
"A flock of small gray goldfinches,","Flown down with silvery twitterings, Rustle",among the birch-cones and are gone.
"It was a bleak and sandy spot, And, all","about, the vacant plot Was peopled and inhabited",By scores of mulleins long since dead.
There was no sound,about the wood Save,the wind's secret stir.
I stood Among the mullein-stalks as still,As if myself had grown to be One of their sombre,"company, A body without wish or will."
"Now overhead, Where the rivulet loiters and","stops, The bittersweet hangs from the tops Of the alders and cherries","Its bunches of beautiful berries, Orange and red."
"And the snowbirds flee, Tossing up on the far","brown field, Now flashing and now concealed, Like fringes of spray That",vanish and gleam on the gray Field of the sea.
"Flickering light, Come the last of the leaves","down borne, And patches of pale white corn In the wind complain, Like",the slow rustle of rain Noticed by night.
"Withered and thinned, The sentinel mullein looms,",With the pale gray shadowy plumes Of the goldenrod; And the,"milkweed opens its pod, Tempting the wind."
"Aloft on the hill, A cloudrift opens and","shines Through a break in its gorget of pines, And it dreams at my feet","In a sad, silvery sheet, Utterly still."
"All things that be Seem plunged into silence, distraught,","By some stern, some necessitous thought: It wraps and enthralls Marsh,","meadow, and forest; and falls Also on me."
Along the narrow sandy height I watch them swiftly,"come and go, Or round the leafless wood, Like flurries of wind-driven snow, Revolving in","perpetual flight, A changing multitude."
"White are the far-off plains, and white The fading forests grow;","The wind dies out along the height, And denser still the snow, A gathering","weight on roof and tree, Falls down scarce audibly."
"The road before me smooths and fills Apace, and all","about The fences dwindle, and the hills Are blotted slowly out; The",naked trees loom spectrally Into the dim white sky.
The meadows and far-sheeted streams Lie still without a sound;,Like some soft minister of dreams The snow-fall hoods me round; In wood and,"water, earth and air, A silence everywhere."
"The evening deepens, and the gray Folds closer earth","and sky; The world seems shrouded far away; Its noises sleep, and I, As","secret as yon buried stream, Plod dumbly on, and dream."
"From this windy bridge at rest, In some former","curious hour, We have watched the city's hue, All along the orange west, Cupola","and pointed tower, Darken into solid blue."
"Subtly conscious, all awake, Let","us clear our eyes, and break Through the cloudy","chrysalis, See the wonder as it is."
"Creeping by the sullen wall, We forego the power to","see, The threads that bind us to the All, God or the Immensity; Whereof",on the eternal road Man is but a passing mode.
"Up the fielded slopes at morn, Where","light wefts of shadow pass, Films upon the bending","corn, I shall sweep the purple grass."
"Sun-crowned heights and mossy woods, And","the outer solitudes, Mountain-valleys, dim with","pine, Shall be home and haunt of mine."
"I shall search in crannied hollows, Where the sunlight scarcely","follows, And the secret forest brook Murmurs, and from nook to nook Forever","downward curls and cools, Frothing in the bouldered pools."
I shall stray by,"many a stream, Where",the half-shut lilies gleam.
Napping out the sultry days In the quiet,"secluded bays; Where the tasseled rushes tower,",O'er the purple pickerel-flower.
I shall hear the grasshoppers,"From the parched grass rehearse, And with drowsy note prolong",Evermore the same thin song.
I shall hear the crickets tell Stories by the humming,"well, And mark the locust, with quaint eyes, Caper in his cloak of gray Like",a jester in disguise Rattling by the dusty way.
"I shall dream by upland fences, Where the season's wealth","condenses Over many a weedy wreck, Wild, uncared-for, desert places, That sovereign","Beauty loves to deck With her softest, dearest graces."
There the long year dreams,"in quiet, And the summer's",strength runs riot.
Shall I not remember,"these, Deep in winter",reveries?
It holds,me,fast.
"A drifting, April, twilight sky, A wind which","blew the puddles dry, And slapped the river into waves That ran",and hid among the staves Of an old wharf.
A watery light Touched bleak the granite,"bridge, and white Without the slightest tinge of gold,",The city shivered in the cold.
All day my thoughts,"had lain as dead, Unborn and",bursting in my head.
From time to time I wrote,a word Which lines and circles,overscored.
My table seemed a,"graveyard, full Of coffins waiting",burial.
"I seized these vile abortions, tore","Them into jagged bits, and swore To be",the dupe of hope no more.
Into the evening,"straight I went, Starved of a",day's accomplishment.
"Unnoticing, I wandered where The city gave a","space for air, And on the bridge's parapet I leant, while","pallidly there set A dim, discouraged, worn-out sun."
"Behind me, where the tramways run,","Blossomed bright lights, I turned to leave, When",someone plucked me by the sleeve.
"""Your pardon, Sir, but I should",be Most grateful could you lend to me A,"carfare, I have lost my purse."
""" The voice","was clear, concise,",and terse.
I turned and met,the quiet gaze Of strange,eyes flashing through the haze.
"Like some Spanish don, Conferring","favours even when Asking an alms, he",bowed again And waited.
"But my pockets proved Empty,","in vain I poked and shoved, No hidden penny",lurking there Greeted my search.
"""Sir, I declare I have","no money, pray forgive, But let me",take you where you live.
""" And so we plodded",through the mire Where street lamps,cast a wavering fire.
I took no note of where we,"went, His talk became the element Wherein","my being swam, content."
It flashed like rapiers in the night,"Lit by uncertain candle-light, When on some moon-forsaken",sward A quarrel dies upon a sword.
"It hacked and carved like a cutlass blade, And the",noise in the air the broad words made Was the cry of the wind at a,window-pane On an Autumn night of sobbing rain.
I walked as though some,opiate Had stung and dulled my,"brain, a state Acute and slumbrous."
"We stopped, a","house stood silent,",dark.
"From the chimney, red","eyes sparked the gloom, And a cricket's",chirp filled all the room.
My host threw pine-cones on the fire,And crimson and scarlet glowed the pyre Wrapped,in the golden flame's desire.
"The chamber opened like an eye, As a","half-melted cloud in a Summer sky The soul of the house stood guessed,",and shy It peered at the stranger warily.
A little shop with,its various ware Spread on,shelves with nicest care.
"Pitchers, and jars, and jugs, and pots, Pipkins,","and mugs, and many lots Of lacquered canisters, black and","gold, Like those in which Chinese tea is sold."
"Chests, and puncheons,","kegs, and flasks, Goblets, chalices,","firkins, and casks."
In a corner three ancient,"amphorae leaned Against the wall,",like ships careened.
There was dusky blue of Wedgewood,"ware, The carved, white figures fluttering there Like",leaves adrift upon the air.
"Classic in touch, but","emasculate, The Greek soul",grown effeminate.
"Eggshell trays where gay beaux knelt, Hand on heart, and","daintily spelt Their love in flowers, brittle and bright, Artificial","and fragile, which told aright The vows of an eighteenth-century knight."

"The old man smiled, ""It has no sheath, 'Twas a little","careless to have it beneath My cloak, for a jostle to my",arm Would have resulted in serious harm.

My host took up a paper,"spill From a heap which lay in an earthen bowl, And lighted",it at a burning coal.
"At either end of the table,","tall Wax candles were placed, each in a small, And slim,",and burnished candlestick Of pewter.
"The old man lit each wick, And the room leapt","more obviously Upon my mind, and I could see",What the flickering fire had hid from me.
"My head grew dizzy, I seemed to hear A battle-cry","from somewhere near, The clash of arms, and the squeal of balls, And",the echoless thud when a dead man falls.
"A smoky cloud had veiled the room, Shot",through with lurid glares; the gloom Pounded with shouts and dying,"groans, With the drip of blood on cold, hard stones."
Sabres and lances in streaks of light Gleamed,"through the smoke, and at my right A creese, like a licking serpent's","tongue, Glittered an instant, while it stung."

Please clear Your,mind of such,imaginings.

""" He pushed me into a great chair Of russet","leather, poked a flare Of tumbling flame, with the old","long sword, Up the chimney; but said no word."
Slowly he walked to,"a distant shelf, And brought back a",crock of finest delf.
He rested a moment a blue-veined,"hand Upon the cover, then cut a band Of paper,","pasted neatly round, Opened and poured."
A sliding sound Came from beneath,"his old white hands, And I saw a little","heap of sands, Black and smooth."

He looked,at,me.

My firm is a very ancient,"house, The entries on my books would rouse Your wonder,",perhaps incredulity.
I inherited from an ancestry Stretching remotely,"back and far, This business, and my clients are As were those of my grandfather's","days, Writers of books, and poems, and plays."
My swords are tempered for every,"speech, For fencing wit, or to carve a breach Through",old abuses the world condones.
These are purchased by men who feel The,"need of stabbing society's heel, Which egotism has",brought them to think Is set on their necks.
I have foils to pink An adversary,"to quaint reply, And I have customers who buy Scalpels",with which to dissect the brains And hearts of men.
Ultramundanes Even,demand some finer kinds To open,their own souls and minds.
But the other,half of my business deals With,visions and fancies.

Through sheeted rain Has come a lustre,"of crimson, And I have watched moonbeams Hushed by",a film of palest green.
It was,"her wings,",Goddess!
"Who stepped over the clouds, And",laid her rainbow feathers Aslant on,the currents of the air.
I followed her for,"long, With gazing eyes and",stumbling feet.
"I followed,",And watched for the flashing,of her wings.
In the city,"I found her, The narrow-streeted",city.
In the market-place I,"came upon her, Bound",and trembling.
Her fluted wings were fastened to,"her sides with cords, She was naked and cold, For that",day the wind blew Without sunshine.
"Men chaffered for her, They bargained","in silver and gold, In copper, in wheat, And",called their bids across the market-place.
"The tall yellow hollyhocks stand,","Still and straight, With their round blossoms spread open,",In the quiet sunshine.
"And still is the old Roman wall, Rough","with jagged bits of flint, And jutting stones, Old and","cragged, Quite still in its antiquity."
"The pear-trees press their branches against it,","And feeling it warm and kindly, The little",pears ripen to yellow and red.
"They hang heavy,","bursting with juice, Against",the wall.
So,"old,",so still!
The sky,is,still.
The clouds make no sound As they,"slide away Beyond the Cathedral Tower,","To the river, And the sea."
It is,"very quiet, Very",sunny.
The myrtle flowers,"stretch themselves in the sunshine,",But make no sound.
The roses push their,"little tendrils up, And climb",higher and higher.
In spots,they have climbed,over the wall.
But they are very,"still, They do not",seem to move.
And the old wall carries them,"Without effort, and quietly Ripens",and shields the vines and blossoms.
A bird in a plane-tree Sings,"a few notes, Cadenced and perfect They",weave into the silence.
The Cathedral,"bell knocks, One, two, three, and again,",And then again.
"It is a quiet sound, Calling","to prayer, Hardly scattering the stillness, Only",making it close in more densely.
The gardener,picks ripe gooseberries For the,Dean's supper to-night.
"It is very quiet,",Very regulated,and mellow.
But the wall,"is old, It has known",many days.
It is a Roman,"wall, Left-over and",forgotten.
Beyond the Cathedral,Close Yelp and mutter the discontents of,"people not mellow, Not well-regulated."
"People who care more for bread than for beauty,","Who would break the tombs of saints, And give the painted windows",of churches To their children for toys.
People who,"say: ""They are dead,",we live!

"Crush the ripe fruit, and cast it","aside, Yet its seeds shall fructify, And",trees rise where your huts were standing.

Tramps doze on,"the window-ledges, Night-walkers pass along",the sidewalks.
The city is squalid and,"sinister, With the silver-barred street in the","midst, Slow-moving, A river leading nowhere."
"Opposite my window,","The moon cuts, Clear and round,",Through the plum-coloured night.

To Ezra Pound With much friendship and admiration,and some differences of opinion The Poet took his,walking-stick Of fine and polished ebony.
Set in the close-grained wood Were quaint,"devices; Patterns in ambers, And",in the clouded green of jades.
"The top was of smooth, yellow ivory,",And a tassel of tarnished gold Hung by a faded cord from,"a hole Pierced in the hard wood, Circled with silver."
For years the,Poet had wrought upon,this cane.
"His wealth had gone to enrich it, His","experiences to pattern it, His labour",to fashion and burnish it.
"To him it was perfect,","A work of art and a weapon, A",delight and a defence.
The Poet,took his walking-stick,And walked abroad.
Peace be,"with you,",Brother.
The Poet,came to a,meadow.
Sifted through the grass,"were daisies, Open-mouthed, wondering,",they gazed at the sun.
The Poet,struck them with his,cane.
"The little heads flew off, and","they lay Dying, open-mouthed and","wondering, On the hard ground."
They are not,"roses,"" said",the Poet.
The Poet,came to,a stream.
Purple and blue flags waded in,the water; In among them hopped the speckled frogs;,"The wind slid through them, rustling."
The Poet lifted his,"cane, And the iris heads fell",into the water.
They floated,"away, torn",and drowning.
"""Wretched flowers,""","said the Poet, ""They are",not roses.
It,is your,affair.
The Poet,came to a,garden.
"Dahlias ripened against a wall, Gillyflowers","stood up bravely for all their short stature, And a trumpet-vine covered",an arbour With the red and gold of its blossoms.
Red and gold,like the brass notes,of trumpets.
The Poet knocked off the stiff heads,"of the dahlias, And his cane lopped the",gillyflowers at the ground.
Then he,severed the trumpet-blossoms,from their stems.
"Red and gold they lay scattered,","Red and gold, as on a battle field; Red","and gold, prone and dying."
"""They were not","roses,"" said",the Poet.
But behind you,"is destruction,",and waste places.
The Poet came home,"at evening, And in the candle-light He",wiped and polished his cane.
The orange candle flame leaped,"in the yellow ambers, And made the jades",undulate like green pools.
It played along the,"bright ebony, And glowed in",the top of cream-coloured ivory.
But these things were,"dead, Only the candle-light made",them seem to move.
"""It is a pity","there were no roses,""",said the Poet.
He perches in,"the slime, inert, Bedaubed with",iridescent dirt.
The ground is here,and there bestud With lumps,of only part-burned coal.
Their sharp and glistening,edges cut His stiffened,fingers.
Through the smut,Gleam red the wounds which,will not shut.
Wet through and shivering,he kneels And digs the slippery coals; like,eels They slide about.
His force all,"spent, He counts his small",accomplishment.
A half-a-dozen clinker-coals Which,still have fire,in their souls.
And in his thought,there burns The topaz fire,of votive urns.
He sees it fling,"from hill to hill, And still consumed,",is burning still.
Higher and higher,"leaps the flame, The smoke an",ever-shifting frame.
He sees a Spanish,"Castle old, With silver steps",and paths of gold.
From myrtle bowers comes the plash Of,"fountains, and the emerald flash Of parrots in the","orange trees, Whose blossoms pasture humming bees."
He knows he feeds the urns whose smoke Bears,"visions, that his master-stroke Is out of dirt and misery",To light the fire of poesy.
"He sees the glory,",yet he knows That others cannot,see his shows.
"To them his smoke is sightless, black, His votive vessels","but a pack Of old discarded shards, his fire A peddler's; still","to him the pyre Is incensed, an enduring goal!"
He sighs,and grubs another,coal.
How should I sing when buffeting,"salt waves And stung with bitter surges, in","whose might I toss, a cockleshell?"
"No parting cloud reveals a watery star, My","cries are washed away upon the wind, My cramped and blistering hands can find","no spar, My eyes with hope o'erstrained, are growing blind."
But painted on the sky,"great visions burn, My voice, oblation",from a shattered urn!
"So up, and down, and forward, inch by","inch, He gains upon the shore, where poppies glow And",sandflies dance their little lives away.
When the stooping sky Leans down upon the,"hills And tenderly, as one who soothing stills An anguish,",gathers earth to lie Embraced and girdled.
Do the,sun-filled men Feel patience,then?
Be,patient with,you?
"When pain's iron bars Their rivets tighten, stern","To bend and break their victims; as they turn, Hopeless, there stand the",purple jars Of night to spill oblivion.
Do these,men Feel,patience then?
My sun,and,moon!
My,basketful,of flowers!
My money-bag,of shining,dreams!
"My hours, Windless","and still, of",afternoon!
You are my world,and I your,citizen.
What meaning,can have patience,then?
Be not angry with me that I bear Your,"colours everywhere, All through each crowded street, And meet The","wonder-light in every eye, As I go by."
"Each plodding wayfarer looks up to gaze, Blinded","by rainbow haze, The stuff of happiness, No less, Which wraps",me in its glad-hued folds Of peacock golds.
Before my feet the,"dusty, rough-paved way Flushes",beneath its gray.
"My steps fall ringed with light,","So bright, It seems a myriad suns",are strown About the town.
Around me is the sound of steepled,"bells, And rich perfumed smells Hang like a wind-forgotten cloud, And shroud",Me from close contact with the world.
You blazon me,with jewelled,insignia.
A flaming,nebula Rims in,my life.
And yet You set,"The word upon me, unconfessed",To go unguessed.
I pray to be the tool which to your hand Long,"use has shaped and moulded till it be Apt for your need, and,","unconsideringly, You take it for its service."
I demand To be forgotten in the woven strand,"Which grows the multi-coloured tapestry Of your bright life, and through its tissues","lie A hidden, strong, sustaining, grey-toned band."
"I wish to dwell around your daylight dreams, The railing to","the stairway of the clouds, To guard your steps securely up, where streams A",faery moonshine washing pale the crowds Of pointed stars.
Remember not,"whereby You mount, protected,",to the far-flung sky.
Before me lies a mass of shapeless,"days, Unseparated atoms, and I must Sort",them apart and live them.
Sifted dust Covers,the formless,heap.
"Reprieves, delays,","There are none,",ever.
As a monk who prays The sliding beads,"asunder, so I thrust Each tasteless particle aside, and",just Begin again the task which never stays.
And I have known a glory,"of great suns, When days flashed by, pulsing",with joy and fire!
Drunk bubbled wine in goblets,"of desire, And felt the whipped",blood laughing as it runs!
"Spilt is that liquor, my too","hasty hand Threw down the cup, and",did not understand.
"Dearest, forgive that",with my clumsy touch I,broke and bruised your rose.
I hardly could suppose It,were a thing so fragile that my,"clutch Could kill it, thus."
"It stood so proudly up upon its stem, I knew","no thought of fear, And coming very near Fell, overbalanced,","to your garment's hem, Tearing it down."
"Now, stooping, I upgather,","one by one, The crimson petals, all Outspread",about my fall.
They hold their,"fragrance still, a blood-red cone Of",memory.
And with my words I carve a little jar To,"keep their scented dust, Which, opening, you must Breathe to your soul,","and, breathing, know me far More grieved than you."
An arid daylight shines along the beach Dried to a grey,"monotony of tone, And stranded jelly-fish melt soft upon The sun-baked pebbles,","far beyond their reach Sparkles a wet, reviving sea."
"Here bleach The skeletons of fishes, every","bone Polished and stark, like traceries of stone, The joints",and knuckles hardened each to each.
And they are dead while,"waiting for the sea, The moon-pursuing","sea, to come again."
Their hearts are,blown away on the,hot breeze.
Only the,shells and stones can wait,to be Washed bright.
"For living things, who","suffer pain, May not endure",till time can bring them ease.
"Happiness, to","some, elation; Is, to others,",mere stagnation.
Days of passive,"somnolence, At its wildest,",indolence.
Hours of empty,"quietness, No delight, and",no distress.
Happiness to me,"is wine, Effervescent,",superfine.
Full of tang and fiery,"pleasure, Far too hot to leave me leisure For",a single thought beyond it.
This the bond:  it,Means to give one's soul to,gain Life's quintessence.
Even pain Pricks to livelier,"living, then Wakes the nerves to laugh again, Rapture's",self is three parts sorrow.
Although we must die,"to-morrow, Losing every thought but this;","Torn, triumphant, drowned in bliss."
Happiness:,We rarely,feel it.
How long shall I tarnish,"the mirror of life, A spatter of",rust on its polished steel!
The seasons reel,Like a goaded,wheel.
"Half-numb,","half-maddened, my days",are strife.
The night is sliding,"towards the dawn, And upturned",hills crouch at autumn's knees.
A torn moon flees Through,"the hemlock trees, The hours",have gnawed it to feed their spawn.
Pursuing and jeering,the misshapen thing A rabble,of clouds flares out of the east.
Like dogs unleashed After,"a beast, They stream on the sky,",an outflung string.
"A desolate wind, through the unpeopled dark, Shakes the","bushes and whistles through empty nests, And the fierce unrests I keep","as guests Crowd my brain with corpses, pallid and stark."
"Leave me in peace, O Spectres,","who haunt My labouring mind, I",have fought and failed.
"I have not quailed,",I was all unmailed And naked I,"strove, 'tis my only vaunt."
The moon drops into,the silver day As waking,out of her swoon she comes.
I hear the drums Of,millenniums Beating the mornings,I still must stay.
"The years I must watch go in and out, While I build","with water, and dig in air, And the trumpets blare Hollow despair,",The shuddering trumpets of utter rout.
An atom tossed in,a chaos made Of yeasting,"worlds, which bubble and foam."

What would,be,home?
I,hear no,answer.
I crave,to be lost like,a wind-blown flame.
"Pushed into nothingness by a breath, And",quench in a wreath Of engulfing death This fight,"for a God, or this devil's game."
There once was a man,"whom the gods didn't love, And a",disagreeable man was he.
"He loathed his neighbours, and his","neighbours hated him, And he",cursed eternally.
"He damned the sun, and","he damned the stars, And he blasted",the winds in the sky.
He sent to Hell every,"green, growing thing, And he raved at",the birds as they fly.
"His oaths were many, and his range was wide,",He swore in fancy ways; But his meaning was plain:  that no,created thing Was other than a hurt to his gaze.
"He dwelt all alone, underneath a leaning","hill, And windows toward the hill there were none, And on the other","side they were white-washed thick, To keep out every spark of the sun."
When he went to market he,walked all the way Blaspheming,at the path he trod.
He cursed at those he bought,"of, and swore at those he sold to, By all",the names he knew of God.
For his heart was soured in,"his weary old hide, And his hopes",had curdled in his breast.
"His friend had been untrue,",and his love had thrown him over For the,chinking money-bags she liked best.
The rats had devoured the contents of,"his grain-bin, The deer had trampled on his corn, His brook had shrivelled in","a summer drought, And his sheep had died unshorn."
"His hens wouldn't lay, and","his cow broke loose, And his old horse perished",of a colic.
In the loft his wheat-bags were,"nibbled into holes By little,",glutton mice on a frolic.
So he slowly lost,"all he ever had, And the blood",in his body dried.
Shrunken and mean he,"still lived on, And cursed that future",which had lied.
"So he dug, and he","delved, with care and pain, And the veins in",his forehead stood taut.
"At the end of an hour,","when every bone cracked, He",gathered up what he had sought.
A dim old vase of,"crusted glass, Prismed while it",lay buried deep.
"Shifting reds and greens, like","a pigeon's neck, At the touch of",the sun began to leap.
"It was dull in the tree-shade, but glowing in the light;","Flashing like an opal-stone, Carved into a flagon; and the colours","glanced and ran, Where at first there had seemed to be none."
It had handles on,"each side to bear it up, And a belly",for the gurgling wine.
"Its neck was slender,","and its mouth was wide, And its",lip was curled and fine.
"Then he carried it home, and","put it on a shelf, But it was",only grey in the gloom.
"So he fetched a pail,","and a bit of cloth, And he",went outside with a broom.
"The old man forgot to swear,",Watching its shadow grown a mammoth,"size, Dancing in the kitchen there."
He forgot to revile,the sun next morning When he found his,vase afire in its light.
And he carried it out,"of the house that day, And kept it",close beside him until night.
And so it,happened from day,to day.
The old man fed his,"life On the beauty of his vase,",on its perfect shape.
And his soul,forgot its former,strife.
And the village-folk came,and begged to see The flagon which,was dug from the ground.
And the old man never,"thought of an oath, in his joy At",showing what he had found.
One day the master of the village,"school Passed him as he stooped at toil, Hoeing for a bean-row, and at","his side Was the vase, on the turned-up soil."
"""My friend,"" said the schoolmaster, pompous and","kind, ""That's a valuable thing you have there, But it might get broken","out of doors, It should meet with the utmost care."
What are you,doing with,it out here?
""" ""Why, Sir,"" said the poor","old man, ""I like to have it","about, do you see?"
To be with,it all,I can.
""" ""You will smash it,"" said","the schoolmaster, sternly right,","""Mark my words and see!"
""" And he walked away,",while the old man looked At his treasure,despondingly.
Then he,"smiled to himself, for",it was his!
He had,"toiled for it,",and now he cared.
"loved its shape, and","its subtle, swift hues, Which his",own hard work had bared.
He would carry it,"round with him everywhere, As",it gave him joy to do.
A fragile,vase should not stand in,a bean-row!
Who would dare,to say,so?
"Then his heart was rested,","and his fears gave way, And he bent",to his hoe again.
"A clod rolled down, and","his foot slipped back, And he lurched",with a cry of pain.
For the blade of the hoe crashed,"into glass, And the vase fell to",iridescent sherds.
The old,"man's body heaved with slow,",dry sobs.
He did,"not curse, he had",no words.
"He gathered the fragments,","one by one, And his fingers",were cut and torn.
Then he made a hole,in the very place Whence the,beautiful vase had been borne.
"He covered the hole, and he","patted it down, Then he hobbled to",his house and shut the door.
He tore up his coat and,nailed it at the windows That no,beam of light should cross the floor.
He sat down in front,"of the empty hearth, And he",neither ate nor drank.
In three days they found,"him, dead and cold, And they said:"," ""What a queer old crank!"
""" Have","at you, you",Devils!
"My back's to this tree, For",you're nothing so nice That the hind-side of,me Would escape your assault.
Come,"on now,",all three!
"Here's a dandified gentleman,","Rapier at point, And a wrist which whirls",round Like a circular joint.
That's just to,anoint And make supple,your limbs.
Tis a pity,the silk Of your waistcoat,is stained.
Your heart's full of,"milk, And so full,",it spills over!
I'm,not of,your ilk.
"You said so, and laughed At","my old-fashioned hose, At the cut of my hair,",At the length of my nose.
To carve it,to pattern I,think you propose.
"Your pardon, young Sir, But",my nose and my sword Are proving themselves,In quite perfect accord.
I grieve to,have spotted,Your shirt.
That blade's not a stick To slash,"right and left, And my skull is too thick To",be cleft with such cuffs Of a sword.
Now a,lick Down the side,of your face.
What a,"pretty, red",line!
Tell the taverns,that scar Was an,honour.
Don't whine That,a stranger,has marked you.
The,"tree's there, You",Swine!
Did you think to get in,"At the back, while your friends Made a little",diversion In front?
"So it ends, With",your sword clattering,down On the ground.
Tis amends I make for your,"courteous Reception of me, A foreigner,",landed From over the sea.
Your welcome,was fervent I,think you'll agree.
"My shoes are not buckled With gold, nor my","hair Oiled and scented, my jacket's Not satin, I wear Corded","breeches, wide hats, And I make people stare!"
"So I do, but my heart Is the heart of","a man, And my thoughts cannot twirl In the limited span 'Twixt","my head and my heels, As some other men's can."
I have business more strange Than the shape of my,"boots, And my interests range From the sky, to the roots Of this","dung-hill you live in, You half-rotted shoots Of a mouldering tree!"
Here's,"at you,",once more.
You can show me the,"door, And jeer at my ways, But",you're pinked to the core.
"And before I have done, I will","prick my name in With the front of my steel, And your lily-white",skin Shall be printed with me.
For,I've come here,to win!
"My cup is empty to-night,","Cold and dry are its sides, Chilled by the",wind from the open window.
Empty and,"void, it sparkles white",in the moonlight.
The room is filled with,the strange scent Of wistaria,blossoms.
They sway in the,moon's radiance And tap,against the wall.
But the cup of my,"heart is still, And cold,",and empty.
"When you come, it brims Red and trembling","with blood, Heart's blood for your drinking; To fill your mouth",with love And the bitter-sweet taste of a soul.
My words are little,jars For you to take and,put upon a shelf.
"Their shapes are quaint and beautiful,",And they have many pleasant colours and lustres,To recommend them.
Also the scent from them,fills the room With sweetness of,flowers and crushed grasses.
You glow in my heart,Like the flames of,uncounted candles.
"But when I go to warm my hands, My","clumsiness overturns the light, And then I stumble",Against the tables and chairs.
"Outside the long window, With","his head on the stone sill, The dog is","lying, Gazing at his Beloved."
His eyes are wet,"and urgent, And his body",is taut and shaking.
It is cold on the terrace; A pale,"wind licks along the stone slabs, But the dog gazes",through the glass And is content.
The Beloved,is writing a,letter.
Occasionally,"she speaks to the dog, But she is",thinking of her writing.
"Does she, too,",give her devotion to,one Not worthy?
Licking passions have bitten their arabesques,"into it, And the mark of them lies, in and out, Worm-like, With the beauty",of corroded copper patterning white steel.
My brain is curved like a,"scimitar, And sighs at its cutting",Like a sickle mowing grass.
But of what,use is all,this to me!
"I, who am",set to crack stones In a,country lane!
My heart is like a cleft,pomegranate Bleeding crimson seeds,And dripping them on the ground.
My heart gapes because,"it is ripe and over-full, And its",seeds are bursting from it.
But how is,this other than a,torment to me!
"I, who am shut","up, with broken crockery,",In a dark closet!
I have been temperate,"always, But I am like to be",very drunk With your coming.
There have been times I feared to walk down,"the street Lest I should reel with the wine of you, And",jerk against my neighbours As they go by.
"I will mix me a drink of stars,-- Large stars","with polychrome needles, Small stars jetting maroon","and crimson, Cool, quiet, green stars."
It will lap and scratch As I swallow,it down; And I shall feel it as a serpent of,"fire, Coiling and twisting in my belly."
The rain gullies the garden,paths And tinkles on the broad,sides of grass blades.
"A tree, at","the end of my arm,",is hazy with mist.
"Even so, I can see","that it has red berries, A scarlet fruit,",Filmed over with moisture.
"It seems as though the rain,","Dripping from it, Should be",tinged with colour.
"I desire the berries,","But, in the mist, I only scratch",my hand on the thorns.
"Probably,","too, they are",bitter.
Hold your apron wide That I may pour my,"gifts into it, So that scarcely shall your two arms",hinder them From falling to the ground.
I would pour them upon you And,"cover you, For greatly do I feel this need Of giving","you something, Even these poor things."
Dearest,of my,Heart!
When I go away,from you The world beats dead Like,a slackened drum.
I call out for you against,the jutted stars And shout into,the ridges of the wind.
"Streets coming fast, One after the other, Wedge","you away from me, And the lamps of the city prick my",eyes So that I can no longer see your face.
"Why should I leave you,",To wound myself upon the sharp,edges of the night?
Hold your soul,open for my,welcoming.
Let the quiet of your spirit bathe me With,"its clear and rippled coolness, That, loose-limbed and weary, I find rest, Outstretched","upon your peace, as on a bed of ivory."
Between us,leapt a gold and,scarlet flame.
Into the hollow,"of the cupped, arched blue Of",Heaven it rose.
Its flickering,tongues up-drew And vanished,in the sunshine.
How it came We,"guessed not, nor what thing could",be its name.
From each to each had,sprung those sparks which flew Together,into fire.
But we knew The,winds would slap and quench,it in their game.
And so we graved and fashioned,"marble blocks To treasure it, and placed",them round about.
With pillared porticos,"we wreathed the whole, And roofed",it with bright bronze.
Behind carved,locks Flowered the tall,and sheltered flame.
"Without, The baffled",winds thrust at a column's,bole.
Beneath this sod lie,the remains Of one who,died of growing pains.
You ask,me for a,sonnet.
"Ah, my Dear, Can",clocks tick back to yesterday,at noon?
Can cracked and fallen leaves,recall last June And leap up on,"the boughs, now stiff and sere?"
"Yes,",tis,that!
"My shadow stretches forward,",and the ground Is dark in front because,the light's behind.
"It is grotesque, with such a funny","hat, In watching it and walking I have found More",than enough to occupy my mind.
I cannot,"turn, the light would",make me blind.
1 A yellow band of light upon the street,"Pours from an open door, and makes a wide Pathway of bright gold",across a sheet Of calm and liquid moonshine.
"From inside Come shouts and streams of laughter, and","a snatch Of song, soon drowned and lost again in mirth, The clip of tankards","on a table top, And stir of booted heels."
Against the patch Of candle-light,"a shadow falls, its girth Proclaims the host","himself, and master of his shop."
2 This is the tavern,"of one Hilverdink, Jan Hilverdink,",whose wines are much esteemed.
Within his cellar men can have to drink The rarest,"cordials old monks ever schemed To coax from pulpy grapes, and with nice art",Improve and spice their virgin juiciness.
"Here froths the amber beer of many a brew, Crowning",each pewter tankard with as smart A cap as ever in his wantonness,Winter set glittering on top of an old yew.
3 Tall candles stand upon the,"table, where Are twisted glasses, ruby-sparked","with wine, Clarets and ports."
Those topaz bumpers,"were Drained from slim, long-necked bottles",of the Rhine.
The centre of the board is piled,"with pipes, Slender and clean, the still unbaptized",clay Awaits its burning fate.
"Behind, the vault Stretches from dim to dark, a","groping way Bordered by casks and puncheons, whose brass stripes And","bands gleam dully still, beyond the gay tumult."
"4 ""For good",old Master,"Hilverdink, a toast!"
""" Clamoured",a youth with tassels,on his boots.
"""Bring out your oldest brandy","for a boast, From that small barrel in the","very roots Of your deep cellar, man."
Why,here is,Max!
"Welcome,","Max, you're scarcely",here in time.
We want to drink to old,"Jan's luck, and smoke His best tobacco",for a grand climax.
"Here, Jan, a paper, fragrant","as crushed thyme, We'll have the best to wish","you luck, or may we choke!"
""" 5 Max Breuck unclasped","his broadcloth cloak,",and sat.
"""Well thought","of, Franz; here's luck to Mynheer",Jan.
""" The host set down a jar;",then to a vat Lost in the distance,"of his cellar, ran."
Max took a pipe as graceful as the,"stem Of some long tulip, crammed it full, and drew The pungent",smoke deep to his grateful lung.
It curled all blue throughout,the cave and flew Into,the silver night.
At once there flung Into the crowded shop,"a boy, who cried to them: 6 ""Oh, sirs, is there some learned","lawyer here, Some advocate, or all-wise counsellor?"
My master sent me to inquire,"where Such men do mostly be, but every door","Was shut and barred, for late has grown the hour."
I pray you tell me where I,"may now find One versed in law, the",matter will not wait.
""" ""I am a lawyer,","boy,"" said Max, ""my mind Is not locked to","my business, though 'tis late."
I shall be glad,to serve what way is in,my power.
"7 Then once more, cloaked and ready, he set out,","Tripping the footsteps of the eager boy Along the dappled cobbles,",while the rout Within the tavern jeered at his employ.
"Through new-burst elm leaves filtered the white moon, Who peered and splashed","between the twinkling boughs, Flooded the open spaces, and took flight Before","tall, serried houses in platoon, Guarded by shadows."
Past the Custom House,They took their hurried way,in the Spring-scented night.
8 Before a,door which fronted a canal,The boy halted.
A dim,tree-shaded,spot.
The water lapped the stones in,"musical And rhythmic tappings, and a galliot Slumbered",at anchor with no light aboard.
The boy,"knocked twice, and steps",approached.
"A flame Winked through the keyhole, then a","key was turned, And through the open door Max went toward","Another door, whence sound of voices came."
He entered a,large room where,candelabra burned.
9 An aged man,in quilted dressing gown,Rose up to greet him.
"""Sir,"" said Max, ""you sent Your",messenger to seek throughout,the town A lawyer.
"I have small accomplishment,","But I am at your service, and my","name Is Max Breuck, Counsellor, at your command."
""" ""Mynheer,"" replied the","aged man, ""obliged Am I,",and count myself much privileged.
I am Cornelius,"Kurler, and my fame Is better known",on distant oceans than on land.
10 My ship has tasted,"water in strange seas, And bartered goods",at still uncharted isles.
She's oft coquetted with,"a tropic breeze, And sheered off",hurricanes with jaunty smiles.
""" ""Tush, Kurler,"" here broke in the","other man, ""Enough of poetry,",draw the deed and sign.
""" The old man seemed to","wizen at the voice, ""My good friend, Grootver,--""",he at once began.
"""No introductions, let","us have some wine, And business, now that",you at last have made your choice.
""" 11 A harsh and","disagreeable man he proved to be, This Grootver,",with no single kindly thought.
"Kurler explained,",his old hands nervously,Twisting his beard.
His vessel,he had bought From,Grootver.
12 Little by little,Max made out the way That Grootver,pressed that poor harassed old man.
"His money he must have,",too long delay Had turned the usurer,to a ruffian.
"13 Such light and foamy silks, like crinkled cream, And","indigo more blue than sun-whipped seas, Spices and fragrant trees, a massive beam Of","sandalwood, and pungent China teas, Tobacco, coffee!"
"""  Grootver",only,laughed.
"Max heard it all, and",worse than all he heard The deed to,which the sailor gave his word.
"He shivered, 'twas as if the villain","gaffed The old man with a boat-hook; bleeding, spent, He begged for",life nor knew at all the road he went.
14 For Kurler had,"a daughter, young and gay, Carefully reared","and shielded, rarely seen."
But on one black and most unfriendly,day Grootver had caught her as she passed between The,kitchen and the garden.
"She had run In fear of him, his evil","leering eye, And when he came she, bolted in her room,","Refused to show, though gave no reason why."
The spinning of her future,"had begun, On quiet nights she heard",the whirring of her doom.
15 Max mended an,"old goosequill by the fire, Loathing his","work, but seeing no thing to do."
He felt his hands were building,"up the pyre To burn two souls, and seized with",vertigo He staggered to his chair.
Before him lay White,paper still unspotted,by a crime.
"""Now, young man, write,""",said Grootver in,his ear.
"""`If in two years my vessel should yet","stay From Amsterdam, I give Grootver, sometime A","friend, my daughter for his lawful wife."
""" 16 And Kurler swore, a palsied,","tottering sound, And traced his name, a","shaking, wandering line."
Then dazed,"he sat there, speechless",from his wound.
Grootver got,"up:  ""Fair voyage,",the brigantine!
""" He shuffled","from the room, and left",the house.
His footsteps wore,to silence down,the street.
At last the,aged man began,to rouse.
With help he once,more gained his trembling,feet.
"""My daughter,","Mynheer Breuck, is friendless",now.
Will,you watch over,her?
I ask,a solemn,vow.
""" 17 Max laid his hand upon the old","man's arm, ""Before God, sir, I vow, when you are gone, So to protect",your daughter from all harm As one man may.
"""  Thus sorrowful, forlorn, The situation","to Max Breuck appeared, He gave his promise almost without","thought, Nor looked to see a difficulty."
"""Bred Gently to watch a mother left alone; Bound by","a dying father's wish, who feared The world's accustomed harshness when he should","be dead; 18 Such was my case from youth, Mynheer Kurler."
"Last Winter she died also, and my","days Are passed in work, lest I should grieve for her, And undo",habits used to earn her praise.
My leisure I will gladly,give to see Your household and your,daughter prosperous.
""" The sailor","said his thanks, but",turned away.
"He could not brook that his humility,","So little wonted, and so tremulous, Should first before",a stranger make such great display.
"19 ""Come here to-morrow as the bells","ring noon, I sail at the full sea, my daughter",then I will make known to you.
Twill be a boon If after I have,"bid good-by, and when Her eyeballs scorch with watching","me depart, You bring her home again."
She lives with one,"Old serving-woman, who has",brought her up.
But that,is no friend for so free,a heart.
No head,to match her,questions.
It,is,done.
And I must,sail away to come,and brim her cup.
20 My ship's the fastest,"that owns Amsterdam As home, so not",a letter can you send.
"I shall be back, before",to where I am Another,ship could reach.
Now your,"stipend--"" Quickly Breuck",interposed.
"""When you once more",Tread on the stones which,pave our streets.
"To-morrow I will be,","at stroke of noon,",At the great wharf.
"""  Then hurrying, in spite Of cake",and wine the old man pressed upon Him ere he,"went, he took his leave and shut the door."
21 'Twas noon in,"Amsterdam, the day was clear, And sunshine",tipped the pointed roofs with gold.
The brown canals ran liquid,"bronze, for here The sun sank deep into",the waters cold.
And every clock,"and belfry in the town Hammered,","and struck, and rang."
"Such peals of bells, To shake the sunny morning","into life, And to proclaim the middle, and the","crown, Of this most sparkling daytime!"
"The crowd swells, Laughing",and pushing toward the quays in,friendly strife.
"22 The ""Horn","of Fortune"" sails away",to-day.
At highest tide,"she lets her anchor go, And",starts for China.
Giddy in freshest,"paint she curtseys low, And beckons to",her boats to let her start.
Blue is the,"ocean, with a flashing",breeze.
The shining,waves are quick to take,her part.
They,push and spatter,her.
"Her sails are loose, Her tackles","hanging, waiting men to seize And haul","them taut, with chanty-singing, as they choose."
23 At the great wharf's,"edge Mynheer Kurler stands, And by his side, his","daughter, young Christine."
"Max Breuck is there,","his hat held in his hands, Bowing",before them both.
The brigantine Bounces,"impatient at the long delay, Curvets","and jumps, a cable's length from shore."
A heavy galliot unloads on,"the walls Round, yellow cheeses, like gold cannon",balls Stacked on the stones in pyramids.
Once more Kurler has,"kissed Christine, and now",he is away.
24 Christine stood rigid like,"a frozen stone, Her hands wrung pale in",effort at control.
Max moved aside and,"let her be alone, For grief exacts each",penny of its toll.
The dancing,boat tossed on the glinting,sea.
A sun-path swallowed it in flaming,"light, Then, shrunk a cockleshell, it came again",Upon the other side.
Now on the,"lee It took the ""Horn","of Fortune""."
Straining sight Could see,"it hauled aboard, men pulling",on the crane.
25 Then up above the eager,"brigantine, Along her slender masts, the sails took","flight, Were sheeted home, and ropes were coiled."
The shine Of the wet,"anchor, when its heavy weight",Rose splashing to the deck.
"These things they saw, Christine","and Max, upon the",crowded quay.
"They saw the sails grow white, then blue in shade, The ship had","turned, caught in a windy flaw She glided imperceptibly away,",Drew farther off and in the bright sky seemed to fade.
"26 Home, through the emptying","streets, Max took Christine, Who would have hid",her sorrow from his gaze.
Before the iron,"gateway, clasped between Each garden","wall, he stopped."
"She, in amaze, Asked,","""Do you enter not","then, Mynheer Breuck?"
My father,told me of your,courtesy.
"Since I am now your charge, 'tis meet for","me To show such hospitality as maiden may,",Without disdaining rules must not be broke.
Katrina will,"have coffee, and she",bakes today.
""" 27 She straight","unhasped the tall, beflowered",gate.
Max started at,"the beauty, at",the glare Of tints.
At either end was set a wide Path,"strewn with fine, red gravel, and such shows Of tulips in",their splendour flaunted everywhere!
"28 From side to side, midway","each path, there ran A longer one which",cut the space in two.
Then the dame Katrina shook,"them down, in pelting showers They plunged to earth,",and died transformed to sugared food.
"29 Against the high, encircling","walls were grapes, Nailed close to feel the baking of",the sun From glowing bricks.
Their microscopic,shapes Half hidden by,serrated leaves.
And one Old cherry,tossed its branches,near the door.
"Bordered along the wall, in beds between,","Flickering, streaming, nodding in the air, The pride of all the garden,",there were more Tulips than Max had ever dreamed or seen.
They,"jostled, mobbed, and",danced.
Max stood,at helpless,stare.
"30 ""Within the arbour, Mynheer Breuck, I'll","bring Coffee and cakes, a pipe, and Father's best Tobacco, brought from countries",harbouring Dawn's earliest footstep.
"""  With girlish zest",To please her guest,she flew.
A moment more,"She came again, with her",old nurse behind.
"Then, sitting on the bench and knitting fast, She talked","as someone with a noble store Of hidden fancies, blown upon the","wind, Eager to flutter forth and leave their silent past."
31 The little apple,leaves above their heads Let fall a,quivering sunshine.
"Quiet,","cool, In blossomed",boughs they sat.
"Beyond, the beds Of tulips blazed,",a proper vestibule And antechamber,to the rainbow.
Dyes Of,prismed richness:,Carmine.
Blues Tinging,dark browns to,purple.
Silvers flushed,To amethyst,and tinct with gold.
Round eyes Of,"scarlet, spotting tender",saffron hues.
Violets sunk,"to blacks, and reds in",orange crushed.
32 Of every,pattern and in every,shade.
"Nacreous,","iridescent,","mottled, checked."
"Some purest sulphur-yellow,",others made An ivory-white,with disks of copper flecked.
Sprinkled and,"striped, tasselled, or keenest",edged.
"Striated, powdered,","freckled, long or",short.
"They bloomed, and seemed strange wonder-moths","new-fledged, Born of the spectrum wedded",to a flame.
The shade within the arbour,"made a port To o'ertaxed eyes, its","still, green twilight rest became."
33 Her knitting-needles clicked and,"Christine talked, This child matured to woman unaware,",The first time left alone.
Now dreams,once balked Found,utterance.
Max thought her,very,fair.
Beneath her cap,"her ornaments shone gold, And",purest gold they were.
Kurler,was rich,And heedful.
Her old maiden,aunt had died Whose darling,care she was.
"Now, growing","bold, She asked, had Max",a sister?
Dropped a stitch,At her own,candour.
Then she,paused and softly,sighed.
34 Two,years was,long!
She loved her,"father well, But fears",she had not.
He had always,been Just sailed or,sailing.
And she must not dwell On,"sad thoughts, he had told her so, and seen",Her smile at parting.
But,she sighed,once more.
Two years was,long; 'twas not one hour,yet!
Mynheer,Grootver she would not,see at all.
"Yes, yes, she knew, but ere","the date so set, The ""Horn of Fortune""",would be at the wall.
When Max had,"bid farewell, she",watched him from the door.
"Such things were Christine's world,","and his was she Winter drew near,",his sun was in her smiles.
"Another Spring, and","at his law he toiled, Unspoken hope",counselled a wise efficiency.
"36 Max Breuck was honour's soul,",he knew himself The guardian of,"this girl; no more, no less."
As one in charge of guineas on a shelf,"Loose in a china teapot, may confess His need, but may",not borrow till his friend Comes back to give.
"So Max, in honour, said No word",of love or marriage; but the days He,clipped off on his almanac.
The,end Must,come!
"The second year, with feet","of lead, Lagged slowly by till Spring",had plumped the willow sprays.
37 Two years had made Christine,"a woman grown, With dignity and",gently certain pride.
But all her childhood,"fancies had not flown, Her thoughts in lovely",dreamings seemed to glide.
Max was her trusted,"friend, did she confess A closer",happiness?
Max,could,not tell.
Two years were over,and his life he found Sphered,and complete.
In restless eagerness,"He waited for the ""Horn","of Fortune""."
Well Had he,"his promise kept, abating",not one pound.
38 Spring,slipped away to,Summer.
Still no,glass Sighted the,brigantine.
Then Grootver came,Demanding Jufvrouw,Kurler.
His trespass,"Was justified, for he had",won the game.
Christine,"begged time, more",time!
"Midsummer went,",And Grootver waxed,impatient.
Still,the ship,Tarried.
"Christine, betrayed","and weary, sank To",dreadful terrors.
"One day,","crazed, she sent",For Max.
"""Come quickly,"" said her","note, ""I skip The worst distress",until we meet.
The,world is,blank.
""" 39 Through the long",sunshine of late afternoon,Max went to her.
"In the pleached alley,","lost In bitter reverie,",he found her soon.
"And sitting down beside her,","at the cost Of all his secret, ""Dear,"" said he, ""what thing",So suddenly has happened?
"""  Then, in tears, She told that Grootver, on the","following morn, Would come to marry her, and shuddering:","""I will die rather, death has lesser fears."
""" Max felt the shackles",drop from the oath which,he had sworn.
"40 ""My Dearest","One, the hid joy",of my heart!
I,"love you,",oh!
you must,indeed have,known.
In strictest honour I have,played my part; But all this misery has,overthrown My scruples.
"If you love me, marry",me Before the sun has dipped,behind those trees.
You cannot be wed,"twice, and Grootver, foiled, Can",eat his anger.
My care it shall be To pay your,"father's debt, by such degrees As I can compass,",and for years I've greatly toiled.
"41 This is not haste, Christine,","for long I've known My love, and silence",forced upon my lips.
I worship you with,all the strength I've shown,In keeping faith.
"""  With pleading",finger tips He,touched her arm.
"Dearest, speak,",I love,you.
Do my words,fall too,swift now?
They've been,in leash so long upon,the brink.
""" She sat quite","still, her body",loose and weak.
Then into,"him she melted,",all her soul at flow.
42 And they were married ere,the westering sun Had disappeared,behind the garden trees.
"The evening poured on them its benison, And","flower-scents, that only night-time frees, Rose up around them from the beamy","ground, Silvered and shadowed by a tranquil moon."
"Within the arbour, long they lay embraced, In such","enraptured sweetness as they found Close-partnered each to each, and thinking soon To","be enwoven, long ere night to morning faced."
"Then, far spent, Our",eyes will close to,undisturbed rest.
For that,desired thing I leave,you now.
"To pinnacle this day's accomplishment,","By telling Grootver that a bootless quest Is his, and",that his schemes have met a knock-down blow.
""" 44 But Christine clung to","him with sobbing cries, Pleading for love's",sake that he leave her not.
And wound her arms,about his knees and thighs As,he stood over her.
"With dread, begot Of Grootver's","name, and silence, and the night,",She shook and trembled.
Words in moaning,plaint Wooed him to,stay.
"She feared,","she knew not why, Yet",greatly feared.
She seemed some,anguished saint Martyred,by visions.
Max Breuck soothed her fright,"With wisdom, then stepped out under",the cooling sky.
45 But at the gate once,more she held him close And quenched her heart,again upon his lips.
"""My Sweetheart,",why this,terror?
I propose,But to be gone one,hour!
"Evening slips Away,",this errand must,be done.
First goes my,"father, if I lose",you now!
""" She grasped him",as in panic lest,she drown.
"Softly he laughed,","""One hour through the",town By moonlight!
That's no place,for foul,attacks.
"Dearest, be","comforted, and clear",that troubled brow.
"46 One hour,","Dear, and then, no more",alone.
We front,another day,as man and wife.
I shall be back almost,"before I'm gone, And midnight shall anoint",and crown our life.
""" Then",through the gate,he passed.
Along the street,She watched his buttons,gleaming in the moon.
He stopped to,wave and turned the,garden wall.
Straight she sank,down upon a,mossy seat.
"Her senses, mist-encircled by","a swoon, Swayed to unconsciousness beneath",its wreathing pall.
47 Briskly,Max walked beside the still,canal.
His step,was firm,with purpose.
"Not a jot He feared this meeting,",nor the rancorous gall Grootver would,spit on him who marred his plot.
He dreaded no,"man, since he could",protect Christine.
He stopped,and laughed,aloud.
His starved,life had not fitted him,for joy.
It strained him to the,utmost to reject Even,this hour with her.
His,heart beat,loud.
"""Damn Grootver,",who can force my,time to this employ!
What boyish,uncontrol To,be so racked.
Then,felt his ticking,watch.
In half an,hour Grootver would,know the whole.
"And he would be returned, lifting","the latch Of his own gate, eager to take",Christine And crush her to his lips.
How,bear,delay?
He broke,into,a run.
"In front, a",line Of candle-light banded the,cobbled street.
Not for many a day,Had he been there to take his,"old, accustomed seat."
"""  And out","they came pell-mell, His",old companions.
"""Max,",where have you,been?
Not,drink with,us?
Indeed,you serve us,well!
How many,months is it since,we have seen You here?

Fill your,throat; Here's beer or,brandy.
"Now, boys,",hold him,fast.

The little white cups bent over the,"ground, And in among the light stems wound A crested","snake, With his eyes awake."
His crest was amber,"glittered with blue, And opaque",so the sun came shining through.
It seemed a,crown with,fiery points.
When he quivered all down,"his scaly joints, From every",slot The sparkles shot.
The nuns huddled,"tightly together, fear Catching",their senses.
But Clotilde must peer,"More closely at the beautiful snake,",She seemed entranced and eased.
Could she make,"Colours so rare,",The dress were there.
The Abbess,shook off her,lethargy.
"""Sisters,",we will walk,"on,"" said she."
Sidling away from the,"snowdrop bed, The line curved forwards,",the Abbess ahead.
Only Clotilde,Was the last to,yield.
When the recreation,hour was done Each went,in to her task.
"Alone In the library, with","its great north light, Clotilde wrought at an exquisite",Wreath of flowers For her Book of Hours.
They framed the,picture she had,"made, Half-delighted and half-afraid."
In a courtyard with a lozenged,"floor The Virgin watched, and through the arched door The angel",came Like a springing flame.
His wings were dipped in violet,"fire, His limbs were strung to",holy desire.
He lowered his head and,"passed under the arch, And the air",seemed beating a solemn march.
The Virgin waited,With eyes,dilated.
Her face was quiet,"and innocent, And beautiful",with her strange assent.
A silver thread,about her head Her halo,was poised.
But in the stead Of,"her gown, there remained The","vellum, unstained."
Clotilde painted the flowers,"patiently, Lingering over",each tint and dye.
"She could spend great pains,","now she had seen That curious,",unimagined green.
A colour,so strange It had seemed,to change.
She thought it,had altered while,she gazed.
At first it had been simple green; then glazed All,"over with twisting flames, each spot A molten colour, trembling","and hot, And every eye Seemed to liquefy."
She had made,"a plan, and her",spirits danced.
"After all, she had only glanced At that","wonderful snake, and she must know Just what hues made the creature",throw Those splashes and sprays Of prismed rays.
When evening prayers,"were sung and said, The nuns lit",their tapers and went to bed.
And soon in the convent there was no,"light, For the moon did not rise until late that night,",Only the shine Of the lamp at the shrine.
Clotilde lay,still in her trembling,sheets.
Her heart,shook her body,with its beats.
She could not see till the moon should,"rise, So she whispered prayers and kept her eyes",On the window-square Till light should be there.
The faintest shadow,of a branch Fell,on the floor.
"Clotilde, grown staunch With solemn","purpose, softly rose And fluttered down between",the rows Of sleeping nuns.
She,almost,runs.
She must go out through the little,side door Lest the nuns who were always praying before,The Virgin's altar should hear her pass.
"She pushed the bolts, and",over the grass The red moon's,brim Mounted its rim.
Her shadow crept up the convent wall As,"she swiftly left it, over all The garden lay the level glow Of","a moon coming up, very big and slow."
The,gravel,glistened.
She stopped,and,listened.
"It was still, and",the moonlight was,getting clearer.
"She laughed a little,",but she felt queerer Than ever,before.
The snowdrop bed,Was reached and she bent,down her head.
On the striped,ground The snake,was wound.
For a moment Clotilde,"paused in alarm, Then she rolled up",her sleeve and stretched out her arm.
She thought she,"heard steps, she must",be quick.
She darted her hand,"out, and seized the thick Wriggling","slime, Only just in time."
The old gardener came muttering,"down the path, And his shadow fell like a broad, black swath,",And covered Clotilde and the angry snake.
"He bit her,",but what difference,did that make!
The Virgin,should dress In his,loveliness.
The gardener was covering,"his new-set plants For the night was chilly, and nothing daunts",Your lover of growing things.
He spied Something to do,"and turned aside, And the moonlight","streamed On Clotilde, and gleamed."
His business,finished the gardener,rose.
"He shook and swore, for the moonlight shows","A girl with a fire-tongued serpent, she Grasping him,","laughing, while quietly Her eyes are weeping."
Is,he,sleeping?
"He thinks it is some holy vision, Brushes that aside","and with decision Jumps--and hits the snake with his stick, Crushes his spine,","and then with quick, Urgent command Takes her hand."
The gardener sucks the poison,"and spits, Cursing and praying as befits A poor",old man half out of his wits.
"""Whatever possessed you, Sister,",it's Hatched of a devil And,very evil.
It's one of them,horrid basilisks,You read about.
They say a man risks,"His life to touch it, but I guess I've",sucked it Out by now.
Lucky I,chucked it Away,from you.
"He is dead now, but his","colours won't fade At once, and by noon I",shall have made The Virgin's robe.
"Oh, Francois, see",How kindly the moon shines,down on me!
I can't die,"yet, For the",task was set.
""" ""You won't die now, for I've","sucked it away,"" Grumbled old","Francois, ""so have your play."
If the Virgin is set on,"snake's colours so strong,--"" ""Francois, don't say","things like that, it is wrong."
""" So Clotilde",vented,Her creed.
"""He can't do","no more harm, Sister,""",said he.
"""Paint as",much as,you like.
"""  And gingerly",He picked up the snake,with his stick.
"Clotilde Thanked him, and begged that","he would shield Her secret, though itching",To talk in the kitchen.
At dawn's first,saffron-spired warning Clotilde,was up.
"And all that morning, Except when she went","to the chapel to pray, She painted, and when the April","day Was hot with sun, Clotilde had done."
"She drooped, though her heart beat loud At","the beauty before her, and her spirit bowed To the",Virgin her finely-touched thought had made.
"A lady,","in excellence arrayed,",And wonder-souled.
From long fasting Clotilde felt weary,"and faint, But her eyes were starred like those of a saint Enmeshed",in Heaven's beatitude.
A sudden clamour,hurled its rude Force to break,Her vision awake.
The door nearly leapt,"from its hinges, pushed By the",multitude of nuns.
"They hushed When they saw Clotilde,","in perfect quiet, Smiling, a little",perplexed at the riot.
And all,the hive Buzzed,"""She's alive!"
He had found the strain Of,"silence too great, and preferred the pain",Of a conscience outraged.
"The news had spread,",And all were convinced Clotilde,must be dead.
"For Francois, to","spite them, Had not seen",fit to right them.
How could we have,guessed Our convent,so blessed!
To,have,you die!
"And I, who am","A hollow, living shell, the",grave Is empty of me.
"Holy Mary, I","crave To be taken, Dear Mother, Instead",of this other.
""" She dropped on her knees and","silently prayed, With anguished hands and",tears delayed To a painful slowness.
The minutes,drew To,fractions.
Then the west wind,"blew The sound of a bell, On",a gusty swell.
It came skipping over the slates of,"the roof, And the bright bell-notes seemed a reproof To","grief, in the eye of so fair a day."
"The Abbess,","comforted, ceased",to pray.
And the sun lit,the flowers In Clotilde's,Book of Hours.
It glistened the green of the Virgin's dress And,"made the red spots, in a flushed excess, Pulse and start; and the violet",wings Of the angel were colour which shines and sings.
The book seemed,a choir Of rainbow,fire.
"The Abbess crossed herself, and each nun Did","the same, then one by one, They filed to the chapel, that incensed prayers",Might plead for the life of this sister of theirs.
"Clotilde,",the,Inspired!
She only,felt,tired.
The old chronicles say,she did not die Until,heavy with years.
And that is why There hangs in the convent,"church a basket Of osiered silver, a holy casket,",And treasured therein A dried snake-skin.
Panels of claret,and blue which shine Under the,moon like lees of wine.
A coronet done in a golden,"scroll, And wheels which blunder and creak as they roll Through",the muddy ruts of a moorland track.
They,daren't,look back!
They are whipping,and cursing the,horses.
What brutes,men are when,they think they're scored.
They are scared,"half out of their wits,",poor souls.
For my lord has a casket,"full of rolls Of minted sovereigns,",and silver bars.
I laugh to,think how he'll show his scars,In London to-morrow.
He whines with,rage In his varnished,cage.
My lady,has shoved her rings over,her toes.
Tis an ancient,trick every night-rider,knows.
"But I shall relieve her of them yet, When",I see she limps in the minuet I must beg to,"celebrate this night, And the green moonlight."
There's nothing to hurry,"about, the plain Is hours","long, and the mud's a strain."
My gelding's uncommonly,"strong in the loins, In half an",hour I'll bag the coins.
"Tis a clear,",sweet night on the,turn of Spring.
The,chase is,the thing!
How the coach flashes,"and wobbles, the moon Dripping",down so quietly on it.
A tune Is beating out,"of the curses and screams, And the cracking",all through the painted seams.
"Steady, old","horse, we'll keep",it in sight.
Tis,a rare fine,night!
There's a clump of trees on,"the dip of the down, And the sky shimmers",where it hangs over the town.
It seems a shame to break the air,"In two with this pistol, but I've my share",Of drudgery like other men.
"Hold up,","you beast, now",what the devil!
Confound this,"moor for a pockholed, evil,",Rotten marsh.
My,right,leg's snapped.
Tis a mercy,"he's rolled, but I'm nicely",capped.
A broken-legged,man and a,broken-legged horse!
They'll,"get me, of",course.
The cursed coach will reach the town And,"they'll all come out, every loafer grown A",lion to handcuff a man that's down.
"Oh, the",coachman's bulleted,hat!
I'll give,it a head,to fit it pat.
_They handcuffed the body just,"for style, And they hung him in chains for the",volatile Wind to scour him flesh from bones.
Way out on the moor you,can hear the groans His gibbet makes,when it blows a gale.
Tis a,common,tale.
"_ Paul Jannes was working very late, For",this watch must be done by eight To-morrow or the,Cardinal Would certainly be vexed.
"So they picked his pocket,",And he paid in jewels for his,slobbering kisses.
This watch was made to buy him blisses,"From an Austrian countess on her way Home,",and she meant to start next day.
"Paul worked by the pointed, tulip-flame Of a tallow","candle, and became So absorbed, that his old clock made him",wince Striking the hour a moment since.
"Its echo, only","half apprehended, Lingered",about the room.
"He ended Screwing the little rubies in,","Setting the wheels to lock and spin, Curling the infinitesimal","springs, Fixing the filigree hands."
Chippings Of,precious stones lay,strewn about.
The table before,him was a rout Of splashes,and sparks of coloured light.
There was yellow gold,"in sheets, and quite A heap of","emeralds, and steel."
Here was,"a gem, there was",a wheel.
And glasses lay like limpid lakes Shining and,"still, and there were flakes Of silver, and shavings of pearl, And little",wires all awhirl With the light of the candle.
He took the watch And wound its hands,"about to match The time, then glanced up to",take the hour From the hanging clock.
"Good,",Merciful,Power!
How came that shadow,"on the wall, No woman",was in the room!
His tall Chiffonier,stood gaunt behind,His chair.
His old,"cloak, rabbit-lined,",Hung from a peg.
The,door was,closed.
Just for a,moment he must,have dozed.
"He looked again,",and saw it,plain.
The silhouette made a blue-black stain On,"the opposite wall, and it never wavered Even when the",candle quavered Under his panting breath.
"What made That beautiful, dreadful thing, that","shade Of something so lovely, so exquisite, Cast from a substance which",the sight Had not been tutored to perceive?
Paul brushed,his eyes across,his sleeve.
"Clear-cut, the Shadow on","the wall Gleamed black, and never",moved at all.
"Paul's watches were like amulets, Wrought into","patterns and rosettes; The cases were all set with stones,","And wreathing lines, and shining zones."
"He knew the beauty in a curve, And",the Shadow tortured every nerve With its perfect,rhythm of outline Cutting the whitewashed wall.
So fine Was the neck he,knew he could have spanned It about with,the fingers of one hand.
The lady,was edged with the,stamp of race.
A,singular vision,in such a place.
He moved the candle to,the tall Chiffonier; the,Shadow stayed on the wall.
He threw his cloak upon,"a chair, And still the lady's",face was there.
From every corner,"of the room He saw, in the patch of","light, the gloom That was the lady."
Her violet bloom,Was almost brighter than that,which came From his candle's tulip-flame.
He set the filigree hands; he laid,The watch in the case which he had made; He put on his,"rabbit cloak, and snuffed His candle out."
The room seemed,stuffed With,darkness.
Softly he crossed,"the floor, And let himself",out through the door.
The sun was flashing,"from every pin And wheel,",when Paul let himself in.
The whitewashed,walls were hot,with light.
The room was the core of a,"chrysolite, Burning and shimmering",with fiery might.
The sun was so bright that,no shadow could fall From the furniture,upon the wall.
Paul sighed as he looked at,the empty space Where a glare,usurped the lady's place.
"He settled himself to his work, but his mind Wandered,","and he would wake to find His hand suspended, his eyes grown dim, And",nothing advanced beyond the rim Of his dreaming.
The Cardinal sent to,"pay For his watch, which had purchased",so fine a day.
But Paul could hardly,"touch the gold, It seemed the price","of his Shadow, sold."
With the first twilight he struck a,match And watched the little blue stars hatch Into,an egg of perfect flame.
"He lit his candle,",and almost in shame At his,"eagerness, lifted his eyes."
"The Shadow was there,",and its precise Outline etched,"the cold, white wall."
The young,"man swore, ""By",God!
"You, Paul, There's",something the matter,with your brain.
Go home now,and sleep off,the strain.
""" The next day was","a storm, the rain Whispered",and scratched at the window-pane.
A grey and,shadowless morning filled,The little shop.
"The watches,","chilled, Were dead and sparkless",as burnt-out coals.
The gems lay on the table,"like shoals Of stranded shells, their colours faded, Mere heaps","of stone, dull and degraded."
"Paul's head was heavy,","his hands obeyed No orders,",for his fancy strayed.
His work became a,simple round Of watches repaired,and watches wound.
The slanting ribbons of the,"rain Broke themselves on the window-pane, But Paul",saw the silver lines in vain.
In the morning,he selected all His,perfect jacinths.
"When, at dusk, the",Shadow grew Upon the,"wall, Paul's work was through."
"Holding the watch, he spoke to","her: ""Lady, Beautiful Shadow, stir",Into one brief sign of being.
"Turn your eyes this way, and seeing This watch, made from","those sweet curves Where your hair from your forehead swerves, Accept the gift",which I have wrought With your fairness in my thought.
"Grant me this, and",I shall be Honoured,overwhelmingly.
""" The Shadow rested","black and still, And the wind sighed",over the window-sill.
Topazes ran in a foamy,"stream Over the cover, the hands were studded With","garnets, and seemed red roses, budded."
"The face was of crystal, and engraved","Upon it the figures flashed and waved With zircons,","and beryls, and amethysts."
"It took a week to make,",and his trysts At night with the,Shadow were his alone.
Paul swore,not to speak till his,task was done.
The night that,the jewel was,worthy to give.
Paul watched the long hours of daylight live To the,"faintest streak; then lit his light, And sharp against the wall's pure white",The outline of the Shadow started Into form.
His burning-hearted Words,so long imprisoned swelled To,tumbling speech.
"Like one compelled, He told the lady all","his love, And holding out the watch above His head, he","knelt, imploring some Littlest sign."
The,Shadow,was dumb.
"Weeks passed, Paul worked in fevered","haste, And everything he made he",placed Before his lady.
The Shadow,kept Its perfect,passiveness.
He wooed her with the work,"of his hands, He waited for those dear",commands She never gave.
"No word, no motion,",Eased the ache of his,devotion.
His days passed in a,"strain of toil, His nights burnt up",in a seething coil.
"Seasons shot by,",uncognisant,He worked.
The Shadow,came to haunt Even,his days.
Sometimes quite plain He,saw on the wall the blackberry stain Of,his lady's picture.
No sun was bright,Enough to dazzle that,from his sight.
Then he,would curse Himself,and her!
"And more, the beauty","he could not make, And give her,",for her comfort's sake!
"He would beat his weary, empty hands Upon","the table, would hold up strands Of silver and gold, and ask her",why She scorned the best which he could buy.
He would pray as to,"some high-niched saint, That she would cure him of",the taint Of failure.
He would clutch the wall With his bleeding,"fingers, if she should fall He could catch, and","hold her, and make her live!"
With sobs he would,ask her to forgive All,he had done.
"And broken, spent, He would call himself",impertinent; Presumptuous; a tradesman; a nothing;,driven To madness by the sight of Heaven.
"There were days when he wooed as a lover,","sighed In tenderness, spoke to his bride, Urged her to","patience, said his skill Should break the spell."
A man's sworn will,"Could compass life, even","that, he knew."
He,would prove,it true!
The edge of,the Shadow never,blurred.
The lips of the,Shadow never,stirred.
He would climb on chairs,"to reach her lips, And pat her",hair with his finger-tips.
"Then, deadly sick, He would lie in a swoon","for hours, while thick Phantasmagoria crowded his","brain, And his body shrieked in the clutch of pain."
"The crisis passed, he would wake and smile With a vacant","joy, half-imbecile And quite confused, not being certain Why he was suffering; a curtain",Fallen over the tortured mind beguiled His sorrow.
Like a little child He would play with his watches,"and gems, with glee Calling the Shadow to look and see How the spots",on the ceiling danced prettily When he flashed his stones.
"""Mother, the green Has",slid so cunningly in between,The blue and the yellow.
"Oh,",please look,down!
One morning he threw the street door,"wide On coming in, and his vigorous stride Made the",tools on his table rattle and jump.
In his hands he carried a,"new-burst clump Of laurel blossoms, whose smooth-barked",stalks Were pliant with sap.
As a husband talks To,"the wife he left an hour ago,",Paul spoke to the Shadow.
"""Dear, you know To-day the calendar calls","it Spring, And I woke this morning gathering","Asphodels, in my dreams, for you."
So I rushed out to see what flowers blew Their pink-and-purple-scented,"souls Across the town-wind's dusty scrolls, And made the approach to the Market",Square A garden with smells and sunny air.
I feel so well and,"happy to-day, I think I shall",take a Holiday.
And to-night,we will have a,little treat.
I am going,to bring you something,to eat!
""" He looked at",the Shadow,anxiously.
It was,quite grave and,silent.
He Shut the outer,door and came And leant,against the window-frame.
"""Dearest,"" he said, ""we",live apart Although I,bear you in my heart.
We look,out each from a different,world.
At any moment,we may be hurled,Asunder.
They follow their,"orbits, we Obey their laws",entirely.
"Now you must come, or I go there,",Unless we are willing to live the flare Of,a lighted instant and have it gone.
""" A bee in",the laurels began,to drone.
A loosened,petal fluttered,prone.
"""Man grows by eating, if you eat","You will be filled with our life, sweet",Will be our planet in your mouth.
"If not, I must parch in death's wide","drouth Until I gain to where you are, And give you myself",in whatever star May happen.
Is it,not ordered,cleverly?
""" The Shadow, bloomed","like a plum, and clear,",Hung in the sunlight.
It,did,not hear.
Paul slipped away,as the dusk began To,dim the little shop.
He ran To the nearest,"inn, and chose with care As much",as his thin purse could bear.
"Returning, he brushed his","tools aside, And laid across the table",a wide Napkin.
He put a glass and,"plate On either side,",in duplicate.
"Over the lady's,","excellent With loveliness,",the laurels bent.
In the centre the,"white-flaked pastry stood, And beside",it the wine flask.
Red as blood Was the wine,which should bring the lustihood Of human,life to his lady's veins.
He put meat on her,"plate and filled her glass, And waited",what should come to pass.
The Shadow,lay quietly on,the wall.
From the street outside,"came a watchman's call ""A",cloudy night.
Rain,beginning,to fall.
""" And still",he,waited.
The clock's,slow tick Knocked on the,silence.
He filled his own glass,full of wine; From his pocket,he took a paper.
"The twine Was knotted,",and he searched a knife From,his jumbled tools.
The cord of,life Snapped as he cut,the little string.
He knew,that he must do the,thing He feared.
"He shook powder into the wine,",And holding it up so the candle's shine Sparked a,"ruby through its heart, He drank it."
"""Dear, never",apart,Again!
You have said,it was mine,to do.
"It is done, and",I am come,to you!
""" Paul Jannes let","the empty wine-glass fall,",And held out his arms.
The insentient wall Stared,"down at him with its cold,",white glare Unstained!
The Shadow,was not,there!
Paul clutched,and tore at his tightening,throat.
"He felt the veins in his body bloat,",And the hot blood run like fire and stones Along,the sides of his cracking bones.
But he laughed as he staggered,"towards the door, And he laughed aloud",as he sank on the floor.
The Coroner took the,"body away, And the watches were",sold that Saturday.
The Auctioneer said,"one could seldom buy Such watches,",and the prices were high.
Holy Mother,"of God, Merciful",Mary.
I am,very,weary.
I have come from a village,"miles away, all day I have been coming,",and I ache for such far roaming.
I cannot walk as,"light as I used, and my",thoughts grow confused.
I am,heavier,than I was.
Mary,"Mother, you",know the cause!
Beautiful Holy,"Lady, take my shame",away from me!
Let this fear be only,"seeming, let it be that I",am dreaming.
For months I have,"hoped it was so, now I am",afraid I know.
"Lady, why should this","be shame, just because I",haven't got his name.
"He loved me, yes,","Lady, he did, and he couldn't",keep it hid.
We,meant to,marry.
Why did,he,die?
That day when they told me he had gone,"down in the avalanche, and could not be found until","the snow melted in Spring, I did nothing."
I,could,not cry.
Why,should,he die?
Why should he,die and his,child live?
His little child,"alive in me, for",my comfort.
"No, Good","God, for my",misery!
"I cannot face the shame, to be","a mother, and not married, and the poor child to",be reviled for having no father.
"Merciful Mother,","Holy Virgin, take away",this sin I did.
Let the,baby,not be.
Only take,the stigma,off of me!
I have told,"no one but you, Holy",Mary.
"My mother would call me ""whore"", and spit","upon me; the priest would have me repent, and have",the rest of my life spent in a convent.
"I am no whore, no","bad woman, he loved me, and",we were to be married.
I carried him always in,"my heart, what did it matter if I",gave him the least part of me too?
"You were a virgin, Holy","Mother, but you had a son, you know there",are times when a woman must give all.
There is some,call to give and,hold back nothing.
I swear I obeyed,"God then, and this child who lives",in me is the sign.
"He is dead,","my beautiful,",strong man!
I shall never,feel him caress,me again.
This is,the only baby,I shall have.
"Oh, Holy","Virgin, protect",my baby!
"My little,",helpless,baby!
"He will look like his father,",and he will be as fast a runner,and as good a shot.
Not that he,shall be no scholar,neither.
How can I,"think such things, I",am not good.
My father will have nothing,"to do with my boy, I shall be",an outcast thing.
"Oh, Mother of our","Lord God, be merciful, take",away my shame!
Let my body,be as it was before,he came.
No little baby for,me to keep underneath my,heart for those long months.
To live,for and to get comfort,from.
I cannot,go home and tell my,mother.
She is,so hard and,righteous.
She never loved my,"father, and we were born for","duty, not for love."
I,cannot,face it.
"Holy Mother,",take my baby,away!
Take away,my little,baby!
I don't,"want it, I",can't bear it!
And I,"shall have nothing,",nothing!
Just be,known as a,good girl.
Have other men want to,"marry me, whom I could not touch,",after having known my man.
"He is gone, my man, I shall","never hear him or feel him again,",but I could not touch another.
I would rather,lie under the snow with my,own man in my arms!
So I shall,live on,and on.
Just a,good,woman.
With nothing to warm my,"heart where he lay, and where he left his",baby for me to care for.
I shall not,"be quite human,",I think.
Merely,a stone-dead,creature.
They will,respect,me.
What do,I care,for respect!
You didn't care for,people's tongues when you were,carrying our Lord Jesus.
God had my man give me,"my baby, when He knew that He was going",to take him away.
His lips will comfort,"me, his hands will",soothe me.
"All day I will work at my lace-making, and",all night I will keep him warm by my side and pray the blessed,Angels to cover him with their wings.
"Dear Mother,",what is it that,sings?
I hear voices,"singing, and lovely silver",trumpets through it all.
They seem just,on the other,side of the wall.
Let me,"keep my baby, Holy",Mother.
He is only a poor lace-maker's,"baby, with a stain upon him, but give me strength",to bring him up to be a man.
Tang of fruitage in the air; Red,boughs bursting everywhere; Shimmering of seeded,grass; Hooded gentians all a'mass.
"Warmth of earth, and cloudless wind Tearing","off the husky rind, Blowing feathered seeds to","fall By the sun-baked, sheltering wall."
Beech trees in a golden,"haze; Hardy sumachs all ablaze, Glowing",through the silver birches.
How that,pine tree shouts,and lurches!
From the sunny,"door-jamb high, Swings the shell",of a butterfly.
Scrape of insect,violins Through the stubble,shrilly dins.
Every blade's a minaret Where,"a small muezzin's set, Loudly calling us",to pray At the miracle of day.
Then the purple-lidded night Westering,"comes, her footsteps light Guided by the radiant",boon Of a sickle-shaped new moon.
"In the brown water, Thick and silver-sheened","in the sunshine, Liquid and cool in the","shade of the reeds, A pike dozed."
Lost among the,shadows of stems He,lay unnoticed.
Suddenly he flicked his,"tail, And a green-and-copper brightness Ran",under the water.
Out from under the reeds,"Came the olive-green light, And orange",flashed up Through the sun-thickened water.
"So the fish passed across the pool, Green and copper,","A darkness and a gleam, And the blurred reflections of the willows",on the opposite bank Received it.
Where is,"she, the woman",who wore it?
The scent of,her lingers,and drugs me!
"A languor, fire-shotted, runs through me, and I crush","the scarf down on my face, And gulp in the warmth and the","blueness, and my eyes swim in cool-tinted heavens."
Around me are,"columns of marble, and","a diapered, sun-flickered pavement."
Rose-leaves blow,and patter against,it.
Below the,stone steps a lute,tinkles.
A jar of green,jade throws its shadow,half over the floor.
A big-bellied Frog hops through the sunlight,"and plops in the gold-bubbled water of a basin, Sunk",in the black and white marble.
The west wind has lifted a scarf On,"the seat close beside me, the blue of it is",a violent outrage of colour.
She draws it more closely,"about her, and it ripples beneath",her slight stirring.
How loud clocks can tick,"when a room is empty,",and one is alone!
"My daffodil-crowned,",Slim and without,sandals!
As the sudden spurt of flame upon darkness,"So my eyeballs are startled with you, Supple-limbed youth among","the fruit-trees, Light runner through tasselled orchards."
You are an almond flower,unsheathed Leaping and flickering between,the budded branches.

And fingering the smooth and,polished kernel I should see that in my hands,glittered a gem beyond counting.
The neighbour sits,in his window and,plays the flute.
"From my bed I can hear him, And the round","notes flutter and tap about the room, And hit against each","other, Blurring to unexpected chords."
"It is very beautiful,","With the little flute-notes all about me,",In the darkness.
"In the daytime, The neighbour",eats bread and onions with one hand And,copies music with the other.
He is fat and has a bald,"head, So I do not look at him, But",run quickly past his window.
There is always,"the sky to look at, Or the",water in the well!
"But when night comes and he plays his flute, I","think of him as a young man, With gold seals hanging from his","watch, And a blue coat with silver buttons."
You are beautiful and faded Like,an old opera tune Played upon a harpsichord; Or,like the sun-flooded silks Of an eighteenth-century boudoir.
In your eyes Smoulder the fallen roses,"of out-lived minutes, And the perfume of your soul Is vague and","suffusing, With the pungence of sealed spice-jars."
"Your half-tones delight me,",And I grow mad with gazing,At your blent colours.
My vigour is,"a new-minted penny, Which",I cast at your feet.
Gather it up,"from the dust, That its sparkle",may amuse you.

I wanted to see,"you in the swimming-pool, White and shining in",the silver-flecked water.

"To be a flower Nodding in the sun, Bending,","then upspringing As the breezes run; Holding up A scent-brimmed cup, Full",of summer's fragrance to the summer sun.
"To be a butterfly Still,","upon a flower, Winking with its painted","wings, Happy in the hour."
Blossoms hold Mines of,gold Deep within the farthest heart,of each chaliced flower.
"To be a cloud Blowing through the blue, Shadowing","the mountains, Rushing loudly through Valleys deep Where torrents keep Always",their plunging thunder and their misty arch of blue.
To be a wave Splintering,"on the sand, Drawing back, but leaving",Lingeringly the land.
Rainbow light Flashes,bright Telling tales of coral caves,half hid in yellow sand.
"Soon they die, the flowers; Insects",live a day; Clouds dissolve in showers; Only,waves at play Last forever.

He whistled a little frivolous tune Which he felt,"to be pulsing with ecstasy, For he thought that success always followed","desire, Such a very superlative fool was he."
A maiden came by on an ambling,"mule, Her gown was rose-red and her kerchief blue, On her lap",she carried a basket of eggs.
"Thought the fool,","""There is certainly",room for two.
""" So he jauntily swaggered",towards the maid And put out,his hand to the bridle-rein.
"""My pretty girl,"" quoth the","fool, ""take me up, For to ride with you",to the town I am fain.
""" But the maiden struck at his",upraised arm And pelted him hotly,"with eggs, a score."
"The mule, lashed into","a fury, ran; The fool went back",to his stone and swore.
Then out of the cloud of settling,"dust The burly form of an abbot appeared, Reading",his office he rode to the town.
And the,"fool got up, for",his heart was cheered.
He stood in the midst,"of the long, white road And swept off his",cap till it touched the ground.
"""Ah, Reverent Sir, well","met,"" said the fool, ""A worthier transport",never was found.
"""I pray you allow me to","mount with you, Your palfrey seems",both sturdy and young.
""" The abbot looked up",from the holy book And cried out in,"anger, ""Hold your tongue!"
"""How dare you obstruct the King's","highroad, You saucy varlet,",get out of my way.
""" Then he gave the fool a","cut with his whip And leaving him smarting,",he rode away.
"The fool was angry,","the fool was sore, And he cursed",the folly of monks and maids.
"""If I could but meet with a","man,"" sighed the fool, ""For a woman fears,",and a friar upbraids.
""" Then he saw a flashing of distant steel And the","clanking of harness greeted his ears, And up the road journeyed","knights-at-arms, With waving plumes and glittering spears."
The fool took notice,"and slowly arose, Not quite",so sure was his foolish heart.
If priests and women,would none of him Was it likely,a knight would take his part?
"They sang as they rode, these lusty boys, When","one chanced to turn toward the highway's side, ""There's a sorry","figure of fun,"" jested he, ""Well, Sirrah!"
"move back, there",is scarce room,to ride.
""" Then the",company halted,and laughed out loud.
"""Was such a",request ever,made to a knight?
""" ""And where are your legs,"" asked","one, ""if you start, You may be inside",the town gates to-night.
""" ""'T is a lazy fellow, let","him alone, They've no room in the town",for such idlers as he.
""" But one bent from his saddle","and said, ""My man, Art thou not ashamed",to beg charity!
"""Thou art well set up, and thy legs are strong, But",it much misgives me lest thou'rt a fool; For beggars get only a beggar's,"crust, Wise men are reared in a different school."
"Purple tree-shadows crept over the road, The level","sun flung an orange light, And the fool laid his head on the hard, gray",stone And wept as he realized advancing night.
"A great, round moon rose over a hill And the","steady wind blew yet more cool; And crouched on a stone a wayfarer sobbed,",For at last he knew he was only a fool.
The stars hang thick in the apple,"tree, The south wind smells of the pungent sea, Gold",tulip cups are heavy with dew.

What,is,poetry?
Is it a mosaic,Of coloured stones which curiously,are wrought Into a pattern?
Softly the water ripples Against,"the canoe's curving side, Softly the birch trees rustle",Flinging over us branches wide.
"From the shore come the scents of a garden,",And between a gap in the trees A proud white statue,"glimmers In cold, disdainful ease."
"The child of a southern people, The thought","of an alien race, What does she in this pale, northern","garden, How reconcile it with her grace?"
But the moon in her wayward beauty Is,"ever and always the same, As lovely as when upon",Latmos She watched till Endymion came.
Through the water the moon writes her legends,"In light, on the smooth, wet sand; They endure for a moment,","and vanish, And no one may understand."
All round us the secret of Nature Is telling,"itself to our sight, We may guess at her meaning but",never Can know the full mystery of night.
"But her power of enchantment is on us,","We bow to the spell which she weaves, Made up of the murmur",of waves And the manifold whisper of leaves.
To me,it is,not so.
"To me alone it is a time of pause, A","void and silent space between two worlds, When inspiration lags, and feeling","sleeps, Gathering strength for efforts yet to come."
"For life alone is creator of life, And closest",contact with the human world Is like a lantern shining in the,night To light me to a knowledge of myself.
"As for a moment he stands, in hardy masculine beauty,","Poised on the fircrested rock, over the pool which below him Gleams in the","wavering sunlight, waiting the shock of his plunging."
"So for a moment I stand, my feet","planted firm in the present, Eagerly scanning the",future which is so soon to possess me.
""" Later the solitude vanished,",confused and distracted the road Where many,were seeking and jostling.
"Left behind were the trees and the flowers,","The half-realized beauty of quiet, the sacred",unconscious communing.
"And now he is come to a river, a","line of gray, sullen water, Not blue and splashing, but dark,",rolling somberly on to the ocean.
But on the far side,is a city whose windows flame,gold in the sunset.
"be strong to uphold him, and bear him","across to the city, The beautiful city",whose spires still glow with the fires of sunset!
"Look, Dear,",how bright the moonlight,is to-night!
See where it casts the,shadow of that tree Far out,upon the grass.
It seems as though the garden which you love Were like,"a swinging censer, its incense Floating before us as a",reverent act To sanctify and bless our night of love.
I need to hear it often,"for my heart Doubts naturally,",and finds it hard to trust.
"Ah, Dearest, you are good to love me so, And yet","I would not have it goodness, rather Excess of selfishness in","you to need Me through and through, as flowers need the sun."
Has your life too been,"waiting for this time, Not only",mine the sharpness of this joy?
"Dear Heart, I love you,",worship you as though I were a priest,before a holy shrine.
"I'm glad that you are beautiful, although Were","you not lovely still I needs must love; But you are all things, it",must have been so For otherwise it were not you.
"Come, close; When you are in the circle",of my arm Faith grows a mountain and I take my,stand Upon its utmost top.
"Yes, yes, once more Kiss me, and","let me feel you very near Wanting me wholly,",even as I want you.
Have,years behind,been dark?
Will those to come,Bring unguessed sorrows into,our two lives?
What does,"it matter, we",have had to-night!
To-night will make us,"strong, for we believe Each in the other,",this is a sacrament.
"I know a country laced with roads, They join the","hills and they span the brooks, They weave like a shuttle between broad","fields, And slide discreetly through hidden nooks."
They are canopied like,a Persian dome And carpeted,with orient dyes.
"They are myriad-voiced,","and musical, And scented with",happiest memories.
O Winding roads that,"I know so well, Every twist and","turn, every hollow and hill!"
They are set in my,heart to a pulsing tune Gay as a,honey-bee humming in June.
O Uphill,roads and roads,that dip down!
"You curl your sun-spattered length along, And your march",is beaten into a song By the softly ringing hoofs of a,horse And the panting breath of the dogs I love.
The pageant of Autumn,follows its course And the blue sky of,Autumn laughs above.
"And the song and the country become as one, I see","it as music, I hear it as light; Prismatic and shimmering, trembling","to tone, The land of desire, my soul's delight."
And always it beats in my listening,"ears With the gentle thud of a horse's stride, With the swift-falling steps","of many dogs, Following, following at my side."
O Roads,that journey to,fairyland!
How,still it,is!
What sound is,that which echoes,through the wood?
Is it the,reedy note of an,oaten pipe?
Perchance a minute more will see the brood,"Of the shaggy forest god, and on his lip Will",rest the rushes he is wont to play.
His train in woven baskets bear ripe fruit And weave a,"dance with ropes of gray acorns, So light their touch the grasses scarcely",sway As they the measure tread to the lilting flute.
t is only,Fancy thus,adorns.
A cloud drifts,idly over the,shining sun.
How damp,"it seems, how silent, still,",and strange!
Surely 't was here some,"tragedy was done, And here the",chorus sang each coming change?
The tread of,sandalled feet comes,noiselessly.
"The silence almost is a sound, and dreams Take on",the semblances of finite things; So potent is the spell that what but,"seems Elsewhere, is lifted here on Fancy's wings."
"The little woodland theatre seems to wait, All","tremulous with hope and wistful joy, For something that is sure to","come at last, Some deep emotion, satisfying, great."
"It grows a living presence,","bold and shy, Cradling the future",in a glorious past.
The octagon tower casts a shade Cool and,"gray like a cutlass blade; In sun-baked vines the cicalas spin,",The little green lizards run out and in.
A sail dips over,"the ocean's rim, And bubbles",rise to the fountain's brim.
"Slowly she walks to the balustrade, Idly",notes how the blossoms fade In the sun's caress; then crosses where,The shadow shelters a carven chair.
"Within its curve, supine","she lies, And wearily closes",her tired eyes.
"The minstrel beseeches his silver strings, And holding the lady","spellbound, sings: -- Down the road to Avignon, The long, long road to Avignon, Across","the bridge to Avignon, One morning in the spring."
"Clouds sail over the distant trees, Petals","are shaken down by the breeze, They fall on the terrace tiles","like snow; The sighing of waves sounds, far below."
A humming-bird kisses,the lips of a rose Then laden with honey,and love he goes.
"Step by step, and","he comes to her, Fearful lest",she suddenly stir.
"Sunshine and silence, and each to each, The","lute and his singing their only speech; He leans above her, her eyes","unclose, The humming-bird enters another rose."
The minstrel,hushes his silver,strings.
The beating,of humming-birds',wings!
"Down the road to Avignon, The long, long","road to Avignon, Across the bridge to","Avignon, One morning in the spring."
I hear the sigh The goaded,"city gives, not day Nor night can ease her","heart, her anguished labours stay."
"Below, straight streets, monotonous, From north and south,","from east and west, Stretch glittering; and luminous Above, one tower",tops the rest And holds aloft man's constant quest: Time!
"Joyless emblem of the greed Of millions, robber","of the best Which earth can give, the vulgar creed Has seared upon",the night its flaming ruthless screed.
Whose soothing presence,brings The quiet shining,of the stars.
Whose cloak of darkness clings So,intimately close that scars Are,hid from our own eyes.
"Beggars By day, our wealth is having night","To burn our souls before altars Dim and tree-shadowed, where the","light Is shed from a young moon, mysteriously bright."
Where art,"thou hiding,",where thy peace?
This is the,"hour, but",thou art not.
Will waking,tumult never,cease?
Hast thou,thy votary,forgot?
"Nature forsakes this man-begot And festering wilderness,","and now The long still hours are here, no jot Of dear communing do","I know; Instead the glaring, man-filled city groans below!"
On winter nights beside the,nursery fire We read the fairy,"tale, while glowing coals Builded its pictures."
The foliage seemed,"to rustle in the wind, A silent","murmur, carved in still, gray stone."
"A sudden blare of trumpets, and",the throng About the entrance parted as the guests Filed,singly in with rare and precious gifts.
Our eager fancies,"noted all they brought, The glorious,",unattainable delights!
But always there was one,unbidden guest Who cursed the child,and left it bitterness.
"The fire falls asunder, all is","changed, I am no more a child, and what I see","Is not a fairy tale, but life, my life."
"The gifts are there, the many pleasant things:","Health, wealth, long-settled friendships, with a name Which honors all who bear it, and",the power Of making words obedient.
This is much; But overshadowing,"all is still the curse, That never shall I",be fulfilled by love!
Along the parching,highroad of the world No other,soul shall bear mine company.
So I behold my visions on,"the ground No longer radiant, an ignoble","heap Of broken, dusty glass."
"And so, unlit, Even by","hope or faith, my dragging steps Force me",forever through the passing days.
"You came to me bearing bright roses, Red",like the wine of your heart; You twisted them into a garland,To set me aside from the mart.
Red roses to crown,"me your lover, And I walked",aureoled and apart.
"Enslaved and encircled,","I bore it, Proud token of",my gift to you.
"The petals waned paler,","and shriveled, And dropped; and the",thorns started through.
Bitter thorns to proclaim,"me your lover, A diadem",woven with rue.
"Dear Bessie, would my tired rhyme Had force","to rise from apathy, And shaking off its",lethargy Ring word-tones like a Christmas chime.
"But in my soul's high belfry, chill The bitter","wind of doubt has blown, The summer swallows all have","flown, The bells are frost-bound, mute and still."
Upon the crumbling boards the snow,"Has drifted deep, the clappers hang Prismed with icicles,",their clang Unheard since ages long ago.
"The rope I pull is stiff and cold, My","straining ears detect no sound Except a sigh, as round and",round The wind rocks through the timbers old.
"Below, I know the church is bright With","haloed tapers, warm with prayer; But here I only",feel the air Of icy centuries of night.
Beneath my feet the snow is lit And,"gemmed with colours, red, and blue, Topaz, and green, where light",falls through The saints that in the windows sit.
"Here darkness seems a spectred thing, Voiceless","and haunting, while the stars Mock with a light of long",dead years The ache of present suffering.
"Silent and winter-killed I stand, No carol","hymns my debt to you; But take this frozen thought in lieu,",And thaw its music in your hand.
Thou father of the children of my brain By thee,"engendered in my willing heart, How can I thank thee for this gift of","art Poured out so lavishly, and not in vain."
"What thou created never more can die, Thy","fructifying power lives in me And I conceive, knowing it","is by thee, Dear other parent of my poetry!"
"All unknown, By me unguessed, by thee","not even dreamed, A tree has blossomed in a night","that seemed Of stubborn, barren wood."
For thou hast sown This,seed of beauty in,a ground of truth.
"Humbly I dedicate myself, and",yet I tremble with a sudden fear to set New,music ringing through my fading youth.
His eyelids burnt and quivered with the,"strain Of looking, and against his temples beat The all","enshrouding, suffocating dark."
"He stumbled, lurched, and struck against a door That opened,","and a howl of obscene mirth Grated his senses, wallowing on the","floor Lay men, and dogs and women in the dirt."
"He sickened, loathing","it, and as he gazed The candle guttered,","flared, and then went out."
"Then as he leaned Unconscious where,","the great oak door blew back And cast him,","bruised and dripping, in the church."
His eyes from long sojourning in,the night Were blinded now as by some glorious sun;,He slowly crawled toward the altar steps.
"He could not think, for heavy in his",ears An organ boomed majestic harmonies; He,only knew that what he saw was light!
He bowed himself before,a cross of flame And shut his eyes,in fear lest it should fade.
Blue through the window,"burns the twilight; Heavy, through trees,",blows the warm south wind.
"Glistening, against","the chill, gray sky light, Wet, black",branches are barred and entwined.
"Sodden and spongy,",the scarce-green grass plot Dents into,pools where a foot has been.
Puddles lie spilt in,"the road a mass, not Of water,","but steel, with its cold, hard sheen."
Faint fades the fire,"on the hearth, its embers",Scattering wide at a stronger gust.
"Above, the old weathercock","groans, but remembers Creaking, to turn, in",its centuried rust.
"Dying, forlorn, in dreary sorrow, Wrapping the","mists round her withering form, Day sinks down; and in darkness to-morrow",Travails to birth in the womb of the storm.
Deeps of unhewn woods Alone,"can cherish thee, alone possess Thy quiet,",teeming vigor.
"This our crime: Not to have worshipped, marred","by alien moods That sole condition of all loveliness,","The dreaming lapse of slow, unmeasured time."
"Dawn fills the room, and penetrating,","bright, The silent sunbeams through the",window pour.
"And she lies sleeping, ignorant","of Fate, Enmeshed in listless dreams, her soul not yet Ripened",to bear the purport of this day.
The morning breeze scarce stirs,"the coverlet, A shadow falls",across the sunlight; wait!
A lark,is singing as,he flies away.
Beyond the ilex,"shadow glares the sun, Scorching against",the blue flame of the sky.
Brown lily-pads lie heavy and supine Within,"a granite basin, under one The bronze-gold glimmer of a carp;",and I Reach out my hand and pluck a nectarine.
Another,year Is quick with,import.
Such,each year has,been.
"Unmoved thou watchest all, and all bequeath","Some jewel to thy diadem of power, Thou pledge",of greater majesty unseen.
A little garden on a,"bleak hillside Where deep the heavy, dazzling mountain",snow Lies far into the spring.
The sun's pale glow Is scarcely,able to melt patches wide About,the single rose bush.
All denied,Of nature's tender,ministries.
"But no, -- For wonder-working",faith has made it blow With flowers,many hued and starry-eyed.
A little,"garden, loved with a",great love!
Thou yellow,trumpeter of,laggard Spring!
Thou herald of,rich Summer's,myriad flowers!
"Always bold To stand erect,",full in the dazzling play Of April's,"sun, for thou hast caught his gold."
T is you that,"are the music,",not your song.
"The song is but a door which, opening","wide, Lets forth the pent-up melody inside, Your spirit's","harmony, which clear and strong Sings but of you."
"Throughout your whole life long Your songs, your thoughts, your","doings, each divide This perfect beauty; waves within a tide,",Or single notes amid a glorious throng.
The song of earth has many different,chords; Ocean has many moods and many,tones Yet always ocean.
In the damp Spring woods The painted,"trillium smiles, while crisp pine cones Autumn",alone can ripen.
So is this One,music with a thousand,cadences.
So still it stands Surely,our own if we exert,our might.
"Never can'st thou grasp this fleeting gleam, Its glowing","flame would die if it were caught, Its value is that it doth always",seem But just a little farther on.
"Distraught, But lighted ever","onward, we are brought Upon our way","unknowing, in a dream."
Brave idolatry,Which can conceive,a hero!
"No deceit, No knowledge taught","by unrelenting years, Can quench this fierce,",untamable desire.
We know that what we,long for once achieved Will cease,to satisfy.
Be still our fears; If what,"we worship fail us, still the fire","Burns on, and it is much to have believed."
Must all of worth be travailled,"for, and those Life's brightest stars rise from",a troubled sea?
Must years go by in sad uncertainty,Leaving us doubting whose the conquering,"blows, Are we or Fate the victors?"
Time which shows All inner,"meanings will reveal, but we Shall",never know the upshot.
Sudden we lack The flash,"of insight, life grows drear and gray, And hour","follows hour, nerveless, slack."
"Austere arbiter of each man's fate, By",whom he learns that Nature's steadfast laws Are as decrees immutable;,O pause Your even forward march!
Not yet too late Teach me the needed,"lesson, when to wait Inactive as a ship when no",wind draws To stretch the loosened cordage.
What instinct forces,"man to journey on, Urged by a longing",blind but dominant!
Nothing he sees can,"hold him, nothing daunt His never",failing eagerness.
The sun Setting in splendour every night,has won His vassalage; those towers flamboyant Of airy,cloudland palaces now haunt His daylight wanderings.
The wind is singing through the,"trees to-night, A deep-voiced song of rushing",cadences And crashing intervals.
Above the tossing trees shines down,"a star, Quietly bright; this wild, tumultuous",joy Quickens nor dims its splendour.
And,"my mind, O",Star!
"is filled with your white light, from far,",So suffer me this one night to enjoy The freedom,of the onward sweeping wind.
"The path runs straight between the flowering rows, A","moonlit path, hemmed in by beds of bloom, Where phlox and marigolds dispute","for room With tall, red dahlias and the briar rose."
T is reckless prodigality,which throws Into the night these wafts of rich perfume,Which sweep across the garden like a plume.
Over,the trees a single,bright star glows.
"How is it that, being gone,","you fill my days, And all the long",nights are made glad by thee?
"No loneliness is this, nor misery, But great content","that these should be the ways Whereby the Fancy, dreaming as she strays,",Makes bright and present what she would would be.
And who shall say if,the reality Is not,with dreams so pregnant.
""" It may",be vain,illusion.
"Alas, how few There are who strike in","us a chord we knew Existed, but so seldom",heard its tone We tremble at the half-forgotten sound.
The world is full of rude awakenings And heaven-born,"castles shattered to the ground, Yet still our human longing vainly",clings To a belief in beauty through all wrongs.
O stay,"your hand, and leave",my heart its songs!
What torture lurks within a single thought When,"grown too constant, and however kind, However welcome","still, the weary mind Aches with its presence."
Dull remembrance taught Remembers on unceasingly; unsought,The old delight is with us but to find That all recurring joy is,"pain refined, Become a habit, and we struggle, caught."
"You lie upon my heart as on a nest, Folded","in peace, for you can never know How crushed I am with",having you at rest Heavy upon my life.
I love you so,You bind my freedom from,its rightful quest.
In mercy,lift your drooping wings,and go.
I do not care to talk to you although Your,"speech evokes a thousand sympathies, And all my being's silent",harmonies Wake trembling into music.
When you go It is as if some,"sudden, dreadful blow Had severed all",the strings with savage ease.
"No, do not talk; but let",us rather seize This intimate,gift of silence which we know.
Others may guess your thoughts,"from what you say, As storms are guessed",from clouds where darkness broods.
To me the very essence of the day Reveals,its inner purpose and its moods; As poplars feel the rain and then straightway,Reverse their leaves and shimmer through the woods.
Now you,are,come!
You tremble like a,"star Poised where, behind earth's","rim, the sun has set."
Your voice has sung across,"my heart, but numb And mute, I have",no tones to answer.
Far Within I kneel before,"you, speechless yet, And life ablaze with","beauty, I am dumb."
How empty,seems the town now,you are gone!
"A wilderness of sad streets, where gaunt walls Hide nothing","to desire; sunshine falls Eery, distorted, as it long","had shone On white, dead faces tombed in halls of stone."
"The whir of motors, stricken through with","calls Of playing boys, floats up at intervals; But all",these noises blur to one long moan.
What quest,is worth,pursuing?
And how strange,That other men still go,accustomed ways!
I hate their interest,in the things they,do.
A spectre-horde,repeating without change,An old routine.
Alone I know,"the days Are still-born, and the","world stopped, lacking you."
All night I wrestled with,a memory Which knocked insurgent,at the gates of thought.
The crumbled wreck of years behind has wrought Its,"disillusion; now I only cry For peace, for power to",forget the lie Which hope too long has whispered.
So I sought The sleep which,"would not come, and night was fraught With old",emotions weeping silently.
"I heard your voice again,",and knew the things Which you had promised,proved an empty vaunt.
I felt your clinging,hands while night's broad wings Cherished,our love in darkness.
From the lawn A,"sudden, quivering","birdnote, like a taunt."
My arms,held nothing but,the empty dawn.
To make a pavement for your feet,"I stripped My soul for you to walk upon, and slipped",Beneath your steps to soften all your ways.
But now my letters,are like blossoms pale We strew upon,a grave with hopeless tears.
"I ask no recompense, I shall not fail Although","you do not heed; the long, sad years Still pass, and still I scatter flowers","frail, And whisper words of love which no one hears."
Throughout the echoing chambers of my,brain I hear your words in mournful cadence toll Like some slow,passing-bell which warns the soul Of sundering darkness.
"Unrelenting, fain To batter down resistance, fall","again Stroke after stroke, insistent diastole, The bitter blows of truth,",until the whole Is hammered into fact made strangely plain.
Where shall,I look for,comfort?
Our worlds are drawn,"apart, our spirit's suns Divided,",and the light of mine burnt dim.
Now in the haunted,twilight I must,do Your will.
I grasp the cup which,"over-runs, And with my trembling",lips I touch the rim.
"""'I can't","get out', said the",starling.
""" Sterne's",Sentimental,Journey'.
Forever the impenetrable wall Of self confines,"my poor rebellious soul, I never see the towering white clouds roll Before","a sturdy wind, save through the small Barred window of my jail."
I live a thrall With all my outer life,"a clipped, square hole, Rectangular; a fraction of a scroll",Unwound and winding like a worsted ball.
My thoughts are grown uneager and,"depressed Through being always mine, my fancy's wings Are",moulted and the feathers blown away.
I weary for desires never,"guessed, For alien passions, strange imaginings, To",be some other person for a day.
"White, glittering sunlight","fills the market square, Spotted",and sprigged with shadows.
"The market glows,","And flaunts, and clatters in",its busy care.
The law of duty urged that he,"should roam, Should sail from fog and chilly airs to",skies Clear with deceitful welcome.
"He had come With proud resolve,",but still his lonely eyes Ached with fatigue,at never seeing home.
Smoulderings Of sacrificial,fires burst their rings And blotted out,in smoke his lost domain.
"Bereft of courtiers,","only with his queen, From empty",palace down to empty quay.
No challenge,screamed from hostile,carabine.
"Boyish,",sympathetic,man!
Crumbled before,thy majesty,we bow.
The little gallery winds round about,"The middle of a most secluded room, Midway between",the ceiling and the floor.
"For books are more than books, they are the life, The very","heart and core of ages past, The reason why men lived, and worked, and","died, The essence and quintessence of their lives."
Silently waiting that from time to time It may be,given them to illuminate Dull daily facts with pristine radiance For,some long-waited-for affinity Who lingers yet in the deep womb of time.
The shifting sun pierces the young green leaves Of,"elm trees, newly coming into bud, And splashes on the floor and on","the books Through old, high, rounded windows, dim with age."
The noisy city-sounds of modern,life Float softened to us across,the old graveyard.
"The room is filled with a warm, mellow","light, No garish colours jar on our content,",The books upon the shelves are old and worn.
T was no belated effort nor attempt To,"keep abreast with old as well as new That placed them here, tricked in a","modern guise, Easily got, and held in light esteem."
"A nothing truly, yet a link that binds All","ages to their own inheritance, And stretching backward, dim and","dimmer still, Is lost in a remote antiquity."
Grapes do not come of thorns nor figs of,"thistles, And even a great poet's divinest thought",Is coloured by the world he knows and sees.
"Nay, the little things Of daily","life it is which mold, and shape, And make him apt",for noble deeds and true.
"The long, still, fruitful hours slip away Shedding",their influences as they pass; We know ourselves the richer,to have sat Upon this dusty floor and dreamed our dreams.
No other place to us,"were quite the same, No other dreams so potent","in their charm, For this is ours!"
The building simply bodies,forth a thought Peculiarly,inherent to the race.
"And we, descendants of that elder","time, Have learnt to love the very form in which The thought",has been embodied to our years.
It takes some time for moss and vines,to grow And warmly cover gaunt and chill stone walls,Of stately buildings from the cold North Wind.
"The lichen of affection takes as long, Or","longer, ere it lovingly enfolds A place which since without it were","bereft, All stript and bare, shorn of its chiefest grace."
"Sea Shell, Sea","Shell, Sing me a","song, O Please!"
"Sea Shell, Sea","Shell, Sing of the things",you know so well.
Near where I live there is a,"lake As blue as blue can be, winds make",It dance as they go blowing by.
I think,it curtseys to,the sky.
It's just a lake of lovely flowers And,my Mamma says they are ours; But they are not like,"those we grow To be our very own, you know."
"We have a splendid garden, there Are lots","of flowers everywhere; Roses, and pinks, and four o'clocks","And hollyhocks, and evening stocks."
Mamma lets us,"pick them, but never Must we",pick any gentians -- ever!
For if we carried,them away They'd die of,homesickness that day.
My Grandpapa lives in a wonderful house,"With a great many windows and doors, There are stairs that go up, and","stairs that go down, And such beautiful, slippery floors."
"But of all of the rooms, even mother's and mine,","And the bookroom, and parlour and all, I like the green dining-room so",much the best Because of its ceiling and wall.
Right over your head is a funny round hole With,apples and pears falling through; There's a big bunch of grapes all purply,"and sweet, And melons and pineapples too."
"They tumble and tumble, but never come down Though I've","stood underneath a long while With my mouth open wide, for I always",have hoped Just a cherry would drop from the pile.
No matter how early I run there to look It,has always begun to fall through; And one night when at bedtime I,"crept in to see, It was falling by candle-light too."
"I am sure they are magical fruits, and each","one Makes you hear things, or see things, or go Forever invisible;","but it's no use, And of course I shall just never know."
For the ladder's too heavy,"to lift, and the chairs Are not nearly",so tall as I need.
"I've given up hope, and",I feel I shall die Without having,accomplished the deed.
"It's a little bit sad, when you seem very near","To adventures and things of that sort, Which nearly begin, and then",don't; and you know It is only because you are short.
Slipping softly through the,"sky Little horned, happy moon, Can you",hear me up so high?
Will you,come down,soon?
On my nursery,window-sill Will you stay,your steady flight?
And then float away,with me Through the,summer night?
"Brushing over tops of trees, Playing","hide and seek with stars, Peeping up through shiny",clouds At Jupiter or Mars.
I shall fill my lap with roses,"Gathered in the milky way, All to",carry home to mother.
what will,she,say!
"Little rocking,","sailing moon, Do you hear",me shout -- Ahoy!
Just a little,"nearer, moon, To please",a little boy.
High up in the apple,"tree climbing I go, With the sky","above me, the earth below."
Each branch is the step of,a wonderful stair Which leads to the,town I see shining up there.
"Climbing, climbing, higher and higher, The branches","blow and I see a spire, The gleam of a turret, the glint of a","dome, All sparkling and bright, like white sea foam."
"On and on, from bough to bough, The leaves are thick,","but I push my way through; Before, I have always had to stop,",But to-day I am sure I shall reach the top.
Today to the end of,"the marvelous stair, Where those glittering",pinacles flash in the air!
"Climbing, climbing, higher","I go, With the sky close above","me, the earth far below."
Naughty little,"speckled trout, Can't I",coax you to come out?
Is it such great fun,to play In the water,every day?
Do you pull the,Naiads' hair Hiding,in the lilies there?
Do you hunt for,"fishes' eggs, Or watch",tadpoles grow their legs?
Do the little trouts have school In some,"deep sun-glinted pool, And in recess play at tag",Round that bed of purple flag?
"I have tried so hard to catch you,",Hours and hours I've sat to watch you; But you never,"will come out, Naughty little speckled trout!"
"He shouts in the sails of the ships at sea, He","steals the down from the honeybee, He makes the forest trees rustle","and sing, He twirls my kite till it breaks its string."
"Laughing, dancing, sunny wind, Whistling,","howling, rainy wind, North, South, East and West, Each is",the wind I like the best.
"He calls up the fog and hides the hills, He whirls","the wings of the great windmills, The weathercocks love him and turn to","discover His whereabouts -- but he's gone, the rover!"
"The pine trees toss him their cones with glee, The","flowers bend low in courtesy, Each wave flings up a shower","of pearls, The flag in front of the school unfurls."
By day you cannot,see the sky For it is,up so very high.
"You look and look,",but it's so blue That you,can never see right through.
But when night comes it,"is quite plain, And all the",stars are there again.
They seem just like old,"friends to me, I've known them",all my life you see.
"There is the dipper first, and there Is","Cassiopeia in her chair, Orion's belt, the","Milky Way, And lots I know but cannot say."
"One group looks like a swarm of bees, Papa",says they're the Pleiades; But I think they must be the,toy Of some nice little angel boy.
Perhaps his jackstones which to-day He has,"forgot to put away, And left them lying on the",sky Where he will find them bye and bye.
I wish he'd,come and play,with me.
"We'd have such fun, for it would",be A most unusual thing for boys,To feel that they had stars for toys!
âWe grasp our battle-spears:,we don our,breast-plates of hide.
The axles of,our chariots touch: our,short swords meet.
Standards obscure the,sun: the foe roll,up like clouds.
Arrows fall thick:,the warriors,press forward.
They menace,our ranks: they break,our line.
The left-hand trace-horse,is dead: the one on,the right is smitten.
The fallen horses,block our wheels: they impede,the yoke-horses!
â They grasp their jade,drum-sticks: they beat the,sounding drums.
Heaven decrees their,fall: the dread Powers,are angry.
The warriors,are all dead: they lie,on the moor-field.
They issued but shall,not enter: they went but,shall not return.
The plains are,flat and wide: the,way home is long.
Their swords lie beside,"them: their black bows, in",their hand.
Though their limbs were,"torn, their hearts could not",be repressed.
They were more than,brave: they were inspired with,the spirit of âWu.
â Steadfast to the,"end, they could not",be daunted.
"Their bodies were stricken, but their",souls have taken Immortality-- Captains among,"the ghosts, heroes among the dead."
"To be an orphan,",To be fated to,be an orphan.
How,bitter is this,lot!
When my father and mother,were alive I used to ride in a carriage,With four fine horses.
"But when they both died,",My brother and sister-in-law Sent me out,to be a merchant.
In the south I travelled,to the âNine Riversâ And in the east as,far as Châi and Lu.
My brother,told me to get,ready the dinner.
My sister-in-law,told me to see after,the horses.
I was always going up,into the hall And running down,again to the parlour.
My,tears fell,like rain.
In the morning they,"sent me to draw water, I",didnât get back till night-fall.
My hands,were all sore And,I had no shoes.
I walked the cold,earth Treading on thorns,and brambles.
As I stopped to,"pull out the thorns, How",bitter my heart was!
My tears fell and,fell And I went on,sobbing and sobbing.
In winter I,have no great-coat; Nor in,"summer, thin clothes."
It is,no pleasure to be,alive.
I had rather quickly,leave the earth And go beneath,the Yellow Springs.
The April winds blow,And the grass is,growing green.
In the third month--silkworms,"and mulberries, In",the sixth month--the melon-harvest.
I went out with the melon-cart,And just as I was coming home The,melon-cart turned over.
"The people who came to help me were few, But","the people who ate the melons were many, All they left me",was the stalks-- To take home as fast as I could.
My brother and sister-in-law,"were harsh, They asked me all sorts",of awful questions.
Why does,everyone in the,village hate me?
I want to write a letter and send it To my mother,"and father under the earth, And tell them I canât go on any",longer Living with my brother and sister-in-law.
She had been ill for years,and years; She sent for me,to say something.
She couldnât say what she,wanted Because of the tears that,kept coming of themselves.
âI have burdened you with,"orphan children, With orphan",children two or three.
Donât let our children,go hungry or cold; If they do,"wrong, donât slap or beat them."
When you take,"out the baby, rock",it in your arms.
"â Last she said, âWhen I carried them in",my arms they had no clothes And now their,jackets have no linings.
_ I shut the doors and,barred the windows And left the,motherless children.
When I got,to the market and met,"my friends, I wept."
I sat down,and could not go,with them.
I asked them,to buy some cakes for,my children.
In the presence,of my friends I,sobbed and cried.
I tried not,"to grieve, but sorrow",would not cease.
I felt in,my pocket and gave my,friends some money.
When I got home I found,my children Calling to be taken,into their motherâs arms.
I walked up and down,in the empty room This way,and that a long while.
Then I went away from,it and said to myself âI will forget,and never speak of her again.
â In the eastern,"quarter dawn breaks, the stars",flicker pale.
The morning cock,at Ju-nan mounts the,wall and crows.
"The songs are over,","the clock run down, but still",the feast is set.
The moon grows dim,and the stars are few; morning,has come to the world.
At a thousand gates and ten thousand,doors the fish-shaped keys turn; Round the Palace and up by the,"Castle, the crows and magpies are flying."
We go to the,Golden Palace: We,set out the jade cups.
We summon the,honoured guests To enter,at the Golden Gate.
They enter at the,Golden Gate And go to,the Golden Hall.
In the Eastern Kitchen the,meat is sliced and ready-- Roast beef,and boiled pork and mutton.
The Master,of the Feast hands round,the wine.
The harp-players,sound their clear,chords.
The cups are pushed aside and,we face each other at chess: The rival,pawns are marshalled rank against rank.
The fire glows and the,smoke puffs and curls; From the incense-burner rises,a delicate fragrance.
The clear wine has made,our cheeks red; Round the table,joy and peace prevail.
May those who shared in this,dayâs delight Through countless autumns enjoy,like felicity.
At fifteen I,"went with the army, At",fourscore I came home.
On the way I met a man,"from the village, I asked him",who there was at home.
âThat over there is your,"house, All covered over with",trees and bushes.
â Rabbits had run in,"at the dog-hole, Pheasants flew down from",the beams of the roof.
In the courtyard was growing,"some wild grain; And by the well,",some wild mallows.
Iâll boil the grain and,"make porridge, Iâll pluck the",mallows and make soup.
Soup and porridge,"are both cooked, But there is no",one to eat them with.
I went out and looked,"towards the east, While tears fell",and wetted my clothes.
In a narrow road where there,was not room to pass My carriage met,the carriage of a young man.
And while his axle was touching,my axle In the narrow road I,asked him where he lived.
âThe place where I live is easy,"enough to find, Easy to find and",difficult to forget.
In the midst of the courtyard grows,"a cassia-tree,-- And candles on its branches",flaring away in the night.
â They fought south,"of the Castle, They died",north of the wall.
They died,in the moors and were,not buried.
Their flesh,was the,food of crows.
âTell the crows we are not,afraid; We have died in the moors,and cannot be buried.
"Crows, how can our",bodies escape,you?
â The waters flowed deep,And the rushes in,the pool were dark.
The riders fought,and were slain: Their horses,wander neighing.
By the,bridge there was,a house.
Was it,"south, was it",north?
The harvest,was never,gathered.
How can,we give you your,offerings?
You served your,"Prince faithfully,",Though all in vain.
"I think of you, faithful",soldiers; Your service shall not,be forgotten.
For in the morning you,went out to battle And at,night you did not return.
I went out at,the eastern gate: I never,thought to return.
But I came back to,the gate with my heart,full of sorrow.
There was not a peck of,rice in the bin: There was not a coat,hanging on the pegs.
So I took,my sword and went,towards the gate.
My wife and child clutched at my coat,and wept: âSome people want to be rich and grand: I only,want to share my porridge with you.
"Above, we have the blue waves","of the sky: Below, the yellow",face of this little child.
"â âDear wife,",I cannot,stay.
Soon,it will be,too late.
When one is growing,old One cannot put,things off.
â She went up the mountain to pluck,wild herbs; She came down the mountain and,met her former husband.
She knelt down and asked,her former husband âWhat do you,find your new wife like?
"â âMy new wife, although her","talk is clever, Cannot charm me",as my old wife could.
In beauty of,face there is not,much to choose.
But in usefulness,they are not at,all alike.
My new wife comes in from,the road to meet me; My old wife always,came down from her tower.
My new wife is clever,at embroidering silk; My old,wife was good at plain sewing.
Of silk embroidery one,can do an inch a day; Of plain,"sewing, more than five feet."
Putting her silks by the side,"of your sewing, I see that the new",will not compare with the old.
â My love is,living To the,south of the Great Sea.
What shall,I send,to greet him?
Two pearls and a comb,of tortoise-shell: Iâll send them to him packed,in a box of jade.
They tell me he is not true: They tell me,"he dashed my box to the ground, Dashed it to the ground and burnt",it And scattered its ashes to the wind.
From this day to the ends,"of time I must never think of him,",Never again think of him.
"The cocks are crowing, And",the dogs are barking-- My brother,and his wife will soon know.
The autumn wind is,blowing; The morning,wind is sighing.
In a moment the,sun will rise in the east And,then _it_ too will know.
I am a prisoner,"in the hands of the enemy, Enduring",the shame of captivity.
My bones stick out and,my strength is gone Through not getting,enough to eat.
My brother is a,Mandarin And his horses,are fed on maize.
Why canât he spare a,little money To send,and ransom me?
If you were riding in a coach,"And I were wearing a âli,â And one day we met","in the road, You would get down and bow."
If you were carrying a âtÄngâ And I,"were riding on a horse, And one day we met in",the road I would get down for you.
I want to be your,friend For ever and ever without,break or decay.
"How swiftly it dries, The","dew on the garlic-leaf, The dew that dries",so fast To-morrow will fall again.
But he whom we,carry to the grave Will never,more return.
What manâs,land is the,graveyard?
It is the crowded,"home of ghosts,-- Wise and foolish",shoulder to shoulder.
The King of the,Dead claims them all; Manâs fate,knows no tarrying.
"On and on, always","on and on Away from you,",parted by a life-parting.
Going from one another,"ten thousand âli,â Each in a different",corner of the World.
The way between is,"difficult and long, Face to face",how shall we meet again?
Since we parted the time,"is already long, Daily my",clothes hang looser round my waist.
Floating clouds obscure the,"white sun, The wandering one",has quite forgotten home.
Thinking of you has made,"me suddenly old, The months and",years swiftly draw to their close.
Iâll put you out of my,mind and forget for ever And try,with all my might to eat and thrive.
"Green, green,",The grass by the,river-bank.
"Thick, thick, The",willow trees in,the garden.
"Sad, sad,",The lady in,the tower.
"White, white,",Sitting at the casement,window.
"Fair, fair,",Her red-powdered,face.
"Small, small,",She puts out her,pale hand.
Once she,was a,dancing-house girl.
Now she,is a wandering,manâs wife.
The wandering,"man went, but did",not return.
It is hard,alone to keep,an empty bed.
"Green, green, The",cypress on,the mound.
"Firm, firm,",The boulder,in the stream.
Manâs life lived within this,"world, Is like the sojourning of",a hurried traveller.
A cup of wine together,"will make us glad, And a little",friendship is no little matter.
Yoking my,chariot I urge my stubborn,horses.
I wander,about in the streets,of Wan and Lo.
In Lo Town,how fine,everything is!
The âCaps and,Beltsâ go seeking,each other out.
The great boulevards are,"intersected by lanes, Wherein",are the town-houses of Royal Dukes.
The two palaces stare,"at each other from afar, The",twin gates rise a hundred feet.
By prolonging the feast,"let us keep our hearts gay, And leave",no room for sadness to creep in.
Of this dayâs glorious,feast and revel The pleasure and delight,are difficult to describe.
Plucking the lute they sent,"forth lingering sounds, The new melodies",in beauty reached the divine.
Skilful singers intoned,"the high words, Those who knew the tune heard",the trueness of their singing.
We sat there each with the same desire And,like thoughts by each unexpressed: âMan in the world lodging for a single life-time,Passes suddenly like dust borne on the wind.
Then let us hurry out with high steps And be,the first to reach the highways and fords: Rather than stay at home,wretched and poor For long years plunged in sordid grief.
â In the north-west there is,"a high house, Its top level",with the floating clouds.
Embroidered curtains thinly,"screen its windows, Its storied tower",is built on three steps.
From above there comes,"a noise of playing and singing,","The tune sounding, oh!"
Who can it,"be, playing so sad",a tune?
Surely it,must be Châi Liangâs,wife.
The tranquil âDâ follows,"the windâs rising, The middle",lay lingers indecisive.
"To each note, two or","three sobs, Her high will conquered by",overwhelming grief.
She does not regret that she,"is left so sad, But minds that so few",can understand her song.
She wants to become,those two wild geese That with beating,wings rise high aloft.
Crossing the river I,pluck hibiscus-flowers: In the orchid-swamps,are many fragrant herbs.
I gather,"them, but who shall",I send them to?
My love,is living in lands,far away.
I turn and look towards,my own country: The long road,stretches on for ever.
"The same heart, yet a different","dwelling: Always fretting, till",we are grown old!
A bright moon illumines,the night-prospect: The house-cricket chirrups on,the eastern wall.
The Handle of the,Pole-star points to the Beginning,of Winter.
The host of stars,is scattered over,the sky.
The white dew wets the,"moor-grasses,-- With sudden swiftness the",times and seasons change.
The autumn cicada,"sings among the trees, The swallows,","alas, whither are they gone?"
Once I had a,"same-house friend, He took flight and",rose high away.
He did not remember how,"once we went hand in hand, But left me like",footsteps behind one in the dust.
In the South is the Winnowing-fan,"and the Pole-star in the North, And a Herd-boy whose ox",has never borne the yoke.
A friend who is not firm as,a great rock Is of no profit,and idly bears the name.
In the courtyard there grows,"a strange tree, Its green leaves ooze",with a fragrant moisture.
Holding the branch I cut a,"flower from the tree, Meaning to send it away",to the person I love.
Its sweet,smell fills my sleeves,and lap.
The road is,"long, how shall I get",it there?
Such a thing is not fine enough,to send: But it may remind him of the time,that has past since he left.
Far away twinkles the,Herd-boy star; Brightly shines the Lady,of the Han River.
"Slender, slender",she plies her white,fingers.
"Click, click go",the wheels of her,spinning-loom.
At the end of the day,she has not finished her task; Her bitter,tears fall like streaming rain.
The Han River runs,shallow and clear; Set between,"them, how short a space!"
But the river water will not,"let them pass, Gazing at each other",but never able to speak.
Turning my,chariot I yoke my,horses and go.
On and on down the,long roads The autumn winds shake,the hundred grasses.
On every,"side, how desolate",and bare!
The things I meet are,"all new things, Their strangeness hastens",the coming of old age.
Prosperity,and decay each have their,season.
Success is bitter,when it is slow,in coming.
Manâs life is not metal,"or stone, He cannot far prolong",the days of his fate.
Suddenly,he follows in the,way of things that change.
Fame is the,only treasure that,endures.
The Eastern Castle,stands tall and high; Far and wide,stretch the towers that guard it.
The whirling wind uprises,and shakes the earth; The autumn grasses,grow thick and green.
The four seasons alternate,"without pause, The yearâs end hurries",swiftly on.
The Bird of the Morning Wind,is stricken with sorrow; The frail,cicada suffers and is hard pressed.
"Free and clear, let",us loosen the,bonds of our hearts.
Why should we,go on always,restraining and binding?
In Yen and Chao are,"many fair ladies, Beautiful people",with faces like jade.
Their clothes,are made all of,silk gauze.
They stand at,the door practising,tranquil lays.
The echo,"of their singing,",how sad it sounds!
By the pitch of,the song one knows the,stops have been tightened.
To ease their minds they arrange,"their shawls and belts; Lowering their song, a",little while they pause.
âI should like to be those two flying,swallows Who are carrying clay to,nest in the eaves of your house.
â I drive my chariot up to,the Eastern Gate; From afar I see,the graveyard north of the Wall.
The white aspens how they,"murmur, murmur; Pines and cypresses",flank the broad paths.
Beneath lie men who,"died long ago; Black, black is",the long night that holds them.
Deep down beneath the,"Yellow Springs, Thousands of",years they lie without waking.
In infinite succession,"light and darkness shift, And years vanish",like the morning dew.
"Manâs life is like a sojourning,",His longevity lacks the firmness,of stone and metal.
For ever it has been,"that mourners in their turn were mourned, Saint","and Sage,--all alike are trapped."
Seeking by food to obtain,Immortality Many have,been the dupe of strange drugs.
Better far to drink,good wine And clothe our bodies,in robes of satin and silk.
The dead are gone and,with them we cannot,converse.
The living are,here and ought to have,our love.
Leaving the city-gate I look,ahead And see before me,only mounds and tombs.
The old graves are ploughed,"up into fields, The pines and cypresses",are hewn for timber.
In the white aspens sad,winds sing; Their long murmuring,kills my heart with grief.
I want to go,"home, to ride to my",village gate.
I want to go,"back, but thereâs no",road back.
The years of a,lifetime do not,reach a hundred.
Yet they contain,a thousand yearsâ,sorrow.
When days are short and,"the dull nights long, Why not take a",lamp and wander forth?
If you want to be happy,"you must do it now, There is no",waiting till an after-time.
The fool whoâs loath to,spend the wealth heâs got Becomes the laughing-stock,of after ages.
It is true that Master,"Wang became immortal, But how can",_we_ hope to share his lot?
"Cold, cold the year draws to its","end, The crickets and grasshoppers",make a doleful chirping.
The chill wind,increases its,violence.
My wandering,love has no coat to,cover him.
He gave his embroidered furs,"to the Lady of Lo, But from me his",bedfellow he is quite estranged.
Sleeping alone in the depth,of the long night In a dream I thought,I saw the light of his face.
My dear one thought of our,"old joys together, He came in his",chariot and gave me the front reins.
I wanted so to prolong,"our play and laughter, To hold his",hand and go back with him in his coach.
"But, when he had come he",would not stay long Nor stop to go with me,to the Inner Chamber.
Truly without the falconâs,wings to carry me How can I rival,the flying windâs swiftness?
I go and lean at the,"gate and think of my grief, My falling",tears wet the double gates.
At the beginning of,"winter a cold spirit comes,","The North Wind blows--chill, chill."
"My sorrows being many, I","know the length of the nights, Raising my head I",look at the stars in their places.
On the fifteenth day the bright,"moon is full, On the twentieth",day the âtoad and hareâ wane.
â I put the letter away,"in the folds of my dress, For three years the",writing did not fade.
How with an undivided,heart I loved you I fear that you,will never know or guess.
"The bright moon, oh, how white","it shines, Shines down on the gauze",curtains of my bed.
Racked by sorrow,I toss and cannot,sleep.
Picking up,"my clothes, I wander",up and down.
My absent love says that he,"is happy, But I would rather he",said he was coming back.
Out in the courtyard,"I stand hesitating,",alone.
To whom,can I tell the sad,thoughts I think?
Staring before me I,enter my room again; Falling,tears wet my mantle and robe.
Autumn wind,rises: white,clouds fly.
Grass and,trees wither:,geese go south.
Orchids all,in bloom: chrysanthemums,smell sweet.
I think of my,lovely lady: I never,can forget.
Across the mid-stream white waves rise Flute and,drum keep time to sound of the rowersâ song; Amidst revel,"and feasting, sad thoughts come; Youthâs years how few!"
The sound,of her silk,skirt has stopped.
On the marble,pavement dust,grows.
Her empty,room is cold,and still.
Fallen leaves are,piled against,the doors.
Longing for that lovely,lady How can I bring my,aching heart to rest?
Is it,or isnât,it?
I,stand,and look.
"The swish,",swish of,a silk skirt.
How slow,she,comes!
Our love was pure As the snow on the mountains:,White as a moon Between the clouds-- Theyâre telling me Your thoughts,are double Thatâs why Iâve come To break it off.
To-day weâll,drink A cup,of wine.
To-morrow weâll part Beside the Canal:,"Walking about Beside the Canal, Where its",branches divide East and west.
Alas,"and alas, And",again alas.
"So must a girl Cry when sheâs married,","If she find not a man Of single heart, Who will",not leave her Till her hair is white.
Since our hair was plaited and,we became man and wife The love between,us was never broken by doubt.
So let us be merry,"this night together, Feasting and",playing while the good time lasts.
I suddenly remember the,distance that I must travel; I spring from,bed and look out to see the time.
The stars and planets are all,"grown dim in the sky; Long, long is",the road; I cannot stay.
I am going on,"service, away to the battle-ground, And I",do not know when I shall come back.
I hold your hand with only,"a deep sigh; Afterwards, tears--in the days",when we are parted.
With all your might enjoy the,"spring flowers, But do not forget",the time of our love and pride.
"Know that if I live, I will come","back again, And if I die, we will go",on thinking of each other.
The good time will never,"come back again: In a moment,--our parting",will be over.
Anxiously--we halt at the,"road-side, Hesitating--we embrace",where the fields begin.
The clouds above are floating,"across the sky: Swiftly, swiftly passing:",or blending together.
The waves in the wind lose,their fixed place And are rolled away each,to a corner of Heaven.
From now onwards--long,must be our,parting.
So let us,stop again for,a little while.
I wish I could ride on,the wings of the morning wind And go with,you right to your journeyâs end.
I came ten thousand leagues Across,sandy deserts In the service of,"my Prince, To break the Hun tribes."
My way was,"blocked and barred, My arrows",and sword broken.
My armies had,"faded away, My",reputation had gone.
My old,mother is,long dead.
Although I want,to requite my Prince How,can I return?
My people have married me In a,far corner of Earth: Sent me away to a,"strange land, To the king of the Wu-sun."
"A tent is my house,",Of felt are my walls; Raw flesh my,food With mareâs milk to drink.
Always thinking,"of my own country, My",heart sad within.
Would I were a,yellow stork And could,fly to my old home!
"Solemn, solemn the",coachman gets ready to go:,"âChiang, chiangâ the harness bells ring."
At break of dawn I,must start on my long journey: At cock-crow,I must gird on my belt.
I turn back and look at,the empty room: For a moment I,almost think I see you there.
"One parting, but ten thousand","regrets: As I take my seat, my",heart is unquiet.
What shall,I do to tell,you all my thoughts?
How can,I let you know of all,my love?
Precious hairpins make,the head to shine And bright mirrors,can reflect beauty.
Fragrant herbs banish,evil smells And the scholarâs,harp has a clear note.
The man in the Book of Odes who,was given a quince Wanted to pay it,back with diamonds and rubies.
When I think of all the things you,"have done for me, How ashamed I am",to have done so little for you!
Although I know that it is,"a poor return, All I can give you is this",description of my feelings.
My poor body is,alas unworthy: I was ill when,first you brought me home.
Limp and weary,in the house-- Time passed and,I got no better.
We could hardly ever,see each other: I could not,serve you as I ought.
Then you received the Imperial,Mandate: You were ordered to go far,away to the City.
"Long, long must be our",parting: I was not destined,to tell you my thoughts.
I stood on tiptoe gazing,"into the distance, Interminably gazing",at the road that had taken you.
With thoughts of you my mind is,obsessed: In my dreams I see,the light of your face.
Now you are started on,your long journey Each day brings,you further from me.
Oh that I had,a birdâs wings And high flying,could follow you.
Long I sob and,long I cry: The tears fall,down and wet my skirt.
On the Eastern Way at the city of,"Lo-yang At the edge of the road peach-trees and plum-trees grow; On the two sides,--flower matched","by flower; Across the road,--leaf touching leaf."
A spring wind rises,from the north-east; Flowers and leaves,gently nod and sway.
Up the road somebodyâs,"daughter comes Carrying a basket,",to gather silkwormsâ food.
(_She sees the fruit trees in blossom,"and, forgetting about her silkworms, begins",to pluck the branches.
_) With her slender hand she,breaks a branch from the tree; The flowers,"fall, tossed and scattered in the wind."
"âLovely lady, I never",did you harm; Why should you hate,me and do me injury?
Though in the autumn your,"leaves patter to the ground, When spring","comes, your gay bloom returns."
But in menâs lives when their,bright youth is spent Joy and love never,come back again.
"â When I was young, throughout",the hot season There were no carriages,driving about the roads.
People shut their doors and,lay down in the cool: Or if they went,"out, it was not to pay calls."
"Nowadays--ill-bred, ignorant","fellows, When they feel the heat,",make for a friendâs house.
"The unfortunate host,","when he hears someone coming Scowls and frowns,",but can think of no escape.
âThereâs nothing for it but to rise,"and go to the door,â And in his comfortable",seat he groans and sighs.
The conversation,"does not end quickly: Prattling and babbling,",what a lot he says!
Only when one is almost,dead with fatigue He asks at last if,one isnât finding him tiring.
(Oneâs arm is almost in half,with continual fanning: The sweat is pouring,down oneâs neck in streams.
) Do not say that this is a,small matter: I consider the practice,a blot on our social life.
I therefore caution,all wise men That August visitors,should not be admitted.
I look up and see / his,curtains and bed: I look down and examine,/ his table and mat.
The things,are there / just as,before.
But the man,they belonged to / is,not there.
His spirit suddenly,/ has taken flight And left me behind,/ far away.
To whom shall,I look / on,whom rely?
My tears flow,/ in an endless,stream.
"âYu, yuâ / cry the wandering",deer As they carry fodder,/ to their young in the wood.
"Flap, flap / fly the birds",As they carry their little,ones / back to the nest.
I alone / am desolate,Dreading the days / of our long parting: My grieving,heartâs / settled pain No one else / can understand.
There is a saying,/ among people âSorrow makes,us / grow old.
"â Alas,",alas / for,my white hairs!
All too,early,/ they have come!
"Long wailing, / long",sighing My thoughts are fixed on,my sage parent.
They say the,good / live long: Then why,was he / not spared?
My charioteer hastens,"to yoke my carriage, For I must go",on a journey far away.
âWhere are you going,on your journey,far away?
â To the land,of Wu where my,enemies are.
But I must ride many,"thousand miles, Beyond the",Eastern Road that leads to Wu.
I want to take a skiff,"and cross these rivers, But alas for","me, where shall I find a boat?"
To sit idle is not my,desire: Gladly enough would I,go to my countryâs aid.
In the North-west there is,"a floating cloud Stretched on high, like",a chariotâs canvas-awning.
Alas that I was born in,"these times, To be blown along like",a cloud puffed by the wind!
It has blown me away,"far to the South-east, On and on",till I came to Wu-hui.
Wu-hui is not my country:,Why should I go on staying,and staying here?
I will give it up and never,"speak of it again,-- This being abroad",and always living in dread.
I climb to the ridge of Pei,Mang Mountain And look down on,the city of Lo-yang.
In Lo-yang,how still it,is!
Palaces and,houses all burnt,to ashes.
Walls and fences all,"broken and gaping, Thorns and brambles",shooting up to the sky.
I do not see the,old old-men: I only see,the new young men.
"I turn aside, for the straight",road is lost: The fields are overgrown and,will never be ploughed again.
I have been away such,a long time That I do not,know which street is which.
How sad and,ugly the empty,moors are!
A thousand miles,without the smoke of a,chimney.
I think of the house,I lived in all those years: I am,heart-tied and cannot speak.
"âWondrous was the wall-stone, Weirdly broken;","Burgh-steads bursten, Giantsâ work tumbleth, Roofs are wrenched,","Towers totter, Bereft of rune-gates."
"Smoke is on the plaster,","Scarred the shower-burghs, Shorn and shattered,",By eld under-eaten.
Earthâs grip,haveth Wealders and,workmen.
â Our wandering,eyes are sated with,the dancerâs skill.
Our ears are,weary with the,sound of âkungâ and âshang.
â Our host is silent,and sits doing nothing: All the guests go,on to places of amusement.
On long benches the,"sportsmen sit ranged Round a cleared room,",watching the fighting-cocks.
The gallant birds are,all in battle-trim: They raise their tails and,flap defiantly.
Their beating wings stir,the calm air: Their angry eyes,gleam with a red light.
"Where their beaks have struck, the fine feathers",are scattered: With their strong talons they,wound again and again.
Their long cries enter the,blue clouds; Their flapping wings,tirelessly beat and throb.
âPray God the lamp-oil lasts a little,"longer, Then I shall not leave without",winning the match!
â In the Nine Provinces there is not room enough: I,"want to soar high among the clouds, And, far beyond the Eight Limits of the","compass, Cast my gaze across the unmeasured void."
The doors of Heaven,"swing open, The double gates",shine with a red light.
The Lord God lies at his western,lattice: And the lesser Spirits are together,in the eastern gallery.
They wash me in a bath,of rainbow-spray And gird me with a,belt of jasper and rubies.
I wander at my ease,gathering divine herbs: I bend down,and touch the scented flowers.
Wang-tzÅ­ gives me drugs,of long-life And Hsien-mÄn,hands me strange potions.
By the partaking of food I evade,the rites of Death: My span is extended to the,enjoyment of life everlasting.
"Flap, flap, you curtain",in front of our,bed!
I hung you there,to screen us from,the light of day.
I brought you with me when I,left my fatherâs house; Now I am,taking you back with me again.
I will fold,you up and lay you,flat in your box.
Curtain--shall I,ever take you out,again?
When I was young I,learnt fencing And was better at,it than Crooked Castle.
My spirit was high,as the rolling clouds And my fame,resounded beyond the World.
I took my sword to,"the desert sands, I drank my",horse at the Nine Moors.
My flags and banners,"flapped in the wind, And nothing was heard",but the song of my drums.
"War and its travels have made me sad, And a",fierce anger burns within me: Itâs thinking of how Iâve wasted,my time That makes this fury tear my heart.
I will cast,out Wisdom and,reject Learning.
My thoughts,shall wander in,the Great Void (_bis_).
Always repenting,of wrongs done Will never bring,my heart to rest.
I cast my hook in a single,stream; But my joy is as though I,possessed a Kingdom.
I loose my hair and,go singing; To the four frontiers,men join in my refrain.
This is the purport,of my song: âMy thoughts shall wander,in the Great Void.
â A gentle wind fans,the calm night: A bright moon shines,on the high tower.
"A voice whispers, but no one","answers when I call: A shadow stirs, but",no one comes when I beckon.
The kitchen-man brings in,"a dish of lentils: Wine is there,",but I do not fill my cup.
Contentment with poverty,is Fortuneâs best gift: Riches and Honour are,the handmaids of Disaster.
Though gold and gems by the,"world are sought and prized, To me they",seem no more than weeds or chaff.
How sad it is,to be a,woman!
Nothing,on earth is held,so cheap.
Boys stand leaning,at the door Like Gods fallen,out of Heaven.
Their hearts brave the Four,"Oceans, The wind and dust of",a thousand miles.
No one is glad when,a girl is born: By _her_ the,family sets no store.
"When she grows up, she hides",in her room Afraid to look,a man in the face.
No one cries when,she leaves her home-- Sudden,as clouds when the rain stops.
She bows her head and composes,"her face, Her teeth are pressed on her red lips:",She bows and kneels countless times.
She must humble,herself even to,the servants.
_His_ love is distant as,"the stars in Heaven, Yet the sunflower",bends toward the sun.
Their hearts more sundered than water,and fire-- A hundred evils,are heaped upon her.
Her face will follow,the yearsâ changes: Her lord,will find new pleasures.
They that were once like,substance and shadow Are now,as far as Hu from Châin.
Yet Hu and Châin shall sooner,meet Than they whose parting is like,Tsâan and ChâÄn.
When I was young I played with,a soft brush And was passionately,devoted to reading all sorts of books.
But then the arrows,began singing at,the frontier.
And a winged summons,came flying to the,City.
Although arms were,"not my profession, I had",once read Jang-ChÅ«âs war-book.
I shouted aloud and my cries,rent the air: I felt as though Tung Wu were,already annihilated.
The scholarâs knife cuts best at its,first use And my dreams hurried on to,the completion of my plan.
I wanted at a stroke to,"clear the Yang-tze and Hsiang, And at a glance to",quell the Tibetans and Hu.
"When my task was done, I should not accept","a barony, But refusing with a bow, retire",to a cottage in the country.
"Flap, flap, the captive bird",in the cage Beating its wings,against the four corners.
"Depressed, depressed the scholar","in the narrow street: Clasping a shadow,",he dwells in an empty house.
"When he goes out, there is nowhere",for him to go: Bunches and brambles,block up his path.
"He composes a memorial,","but it is rejected and unread, He is left stranded,",like a fish in a dry pond.
Without--he has not a single farthing,of salary: Within--there is not a peck,of grain in his larder.
His relations upbraid him,for his lack of success: His friends and callers,daily decrease in number.
I once hoped to pluck,"the fruits of life: But now alas,",they are all withered and dry.
"Though one drinks at a river, one cannot","drink more than a bellyful; Enough is good, but",there is no use in satiety.
The bird in a forest can,"perch but on one bough, And this should",be the wise manâs pattern.
At Pei-mang how they rise,"to Heaven, Those high mounds, four",or five in the fields!
What men lie,buried under,these tombs?
All of,them were Lords,of the Han world.
"When the dynasty was falling,","tumult and disorder arose, Thieves and",robbers roamed like wild beasts.
Of earth they have carried away,"more than one handful, They have gone into",vaults and opened the secret doors.
Over everything the,tangled thorns are growing: A herd-boy pushes,through them up the path.
Down in the thorns rabbits,have made their burrows: The weeds and thistles,will never be cleared away.
Over the tombs the ploughshare,will be driven And peasants will have their,fields and orchards there.
They that were once lords of a,thousand hosts Are now become the dust,of the hills and ridges.
"â When I was alive, I wandered in",the streets of the Capital: Now that I am,"dead, I am left to lie in the fields."
In the morning I drove,out from the High Hall: In the evening I,lodged beneath the Yellow Springs.
When the white sun had sunk in,the Western Chasm I hung up my chariot,and rested my four horses.
"Now, even the mighty",Maker of All Could not bring the,life back to my limbs.
Shape and substance day,by day will vanish: Hair and teeth will,gradually fall away.
Forever from of,old men have been so: And none,born can escape this thing.
"Living in retirement beyond the World,","Silently enjoying isolation, I pull the rope of my door",tighter And stuff my window with roots and ferns.
My spirit is tuned to,the Spring-season: At the fall of the,year there is autumn in my heart.
Thus imitating,cosmic changes My cottage becomes,a Universe.
"Shady, shady the wood",in front of the Hall: At midsummer,full of calm shadows.
The south wind follows summerâs,train: With its eddying-puffs it blows,open my coat.
I am free from,ties and can live a life of,retirement.
When I rise,"from sleep, I play with",books and harp.
The lettuce in the garden,still grows moist: Of last yearâs grain there is,always plenty left.
Self-support should maintain strict,limits: More than enough,is not what I want.
I grind millet and make,"good wine: When the wine is heated,",I pour it out for myself.
My little children are,"playing at my side, Learning to","talk, they babble unformed sounds."
These things have made me happy,again And I forget my,lost cap of office.
"Distant, distant I gaze at the white",clouds: With a deep yearning I think of the,Sages of Antiquity.
In the quiet of the morning,I heard a knock at my door: I threw on my,clothes and opened it myself.
I asked who it was who had come so,"early to see me: He said he was a peasant,",coming with good intent.
He brought a present of,"wine and rice-soup, Believing that I had",fallen on evil days.
âYou live in rags under a,thatched roof And seem to have no,desire for a better lot.
The rest of mankind have,"all the same ambitions: You, too, must",learn to wallow in their mire.
"â âOld man, I am impressed","by what you say, But my soul is",not fashioned like other menâs.
To drive in their rut I might,perhaps learn: To be untrue to myself,could only lead to muddle.
Let us drink and enjoy together,the wine you have brought: For my course is set and,cannot now be altered.
â A long time ago I went,"on a journey, Right to the corner",Of the Eastern Ocean.
The road there Was,"long and winding, And stormy",waves Barred my path.
What made me,Go this,way?
Hunger drove,me Into,the World.
I tried hard To fill,my belly: And even a,little Seemed a lot.
But this was clearly,"A bad bargain, So I went",home And lived in idleness.
"High and low, wise and","simple, all busily hoard",up the moments of life.
Therefore I have to the uttermost exposed the,"bitterness both of Substance and Shadow, and have made Spirit show how,","by following Nature, we may dissolve this bitterness."
Heaven and Earth exist,for ever: Mountains and rivers,never change.
But herbs and trees in perpetual rotation,"Are renovated and withered by the dews and frosts: And Man the wise,",Man the divine-- Shall he alone escape this law?
Fortuitously appearing,for a moment in the World He suddenly,"departs, never to return."
How can he know that,the friends he has left Are missing,him and thinking of him?
Only the things that,he used remain; They look upon,them and their tears flow.
Me no magical,"arts can save, Though you may hope",for a wizardâs aid.
I beg you listen,to this advice-- When you can get,"wine, be sure to drink it."
There is,no way to preserve,life.
Drugs of,Immortality,are instruments of folly.
I would gladly wander,"in Paradise, But it is far",away and there is no road.
Since the day that I,was joined to you We have shared,all our joys and pains.
"While you rested in the shade,",I left you a while: But till the end,we shall be together.
Our joint existence,is impermanent: Sadly together,we shall slip away.
That when the body decays Fame,should also go Is a thought,"unendurable, burning the heart."
Let us strive and,labour while yet we may To,do some deed that men will praise.
Wine may in truth dispel,"our sorrow, But how compare",it with lasting Fame?
God can only set,in motion: He cannot control,the things he has made.
"Man, the second","of the Three Orders, Owes his",precedence to Me.
"Though I am different from you, We were",born involved in one another: Nor by any means can we,escape The intimate sharing of good and ill.
The Three,Emperors were saintly,"men, Yet to-day--where are they?"
PâÄng lived to a,"great age, Yet he went at last, when",he longed to stay.
"And late or soon,",all go: Wise and simple,have no reprieve.
Wine may bring,"forgetfulness, But does",it not hasten old-age?
If you set your heart,"on noble deeds, How do you",know that any will praise you?
Chill and harsh the year draws,to its close: In my cotton dress,I seek sunlight on the porch.
In the southern orchard,all the leaves are gone: In the north,garden rotting boughs lie heaped.
I empty my cup and,drink it down to the dregs: I look towards,"the kitchen, but no smoke rises."
Poems and books lie piled beside,my chair: But the light is going and I shall,not have time to read them.
My life here is not like the,"Agony in ChâÄn, But often I",have to bear bitter reproaches.
"Let me then remember, to","calm my heartâs distress, That the Sages",of old were often in like case.
"White hair covers my temples, I am","wrinkled and seared beyond repair, And though I have","got five sons, They all hate paper and brush."
A-shu is eighteen: For,laziness there is,none like him.
A-hsÃ¼an does his,"best, But really",loathes the Fine Arts.
But,does not,know âsixâ from âseven.
â Tâung-tzÅ­ in his ninth,year Is only concerned,with things to eat.
If Heaven treats,"me like this, What can I",do but fill my cup?
I built my hut in a zone,"of human habitation, Yet near me there",sounds no noise of horse or coach.
Would you know,how that is,possible?
A heart that is,distant creates a,wilderness round it.
I pluck chrysanthemums under,"the eastern hedge, Then gaze long at the",distant summer hills.
The mountain air is fresh at,the dusk of day: The flying birds,two by two return.
In these things there lies a,"deep meaning; Yet when we would express it,",words suddenly fail us.
My old desire to live in the,Southern Village Was not because I had taken,a fancy to the house.
But I heard it was a place,of simple-minded men With whom it were a joy to,spend the mornings and evenings.
Many years I had longed,to settle here: Now at last I have,managed to move house.
I do not mind if my cottage,is rather small So long as thereâs room enough,for bed and mat.
Often and often the,neighbours come to see me And with brave words,discuss the things of old.
Rare writings we read together,and praise: Doubtful meanings we examine,together and settle.
"When I was young, I was out",of tune with the herd: My only love,was for the hills and mountains.
Unwitting I fell into,the Web of the Worldâs dust And was not,free until my thirtieth year.
The migrant bird longs,for the old wood: The fish in the tank thinks,of its native pool.
I had rescued from wildness a patch,"of the Southern Moor And, still rustic, I",returned to field and garden.
My ground covers no more than,ten acres: My thatched cottage,has eight or nine rooms.
Elms and willows cluster,by the eaves: Peach trees and plum trees,grow before the Hall.
"Hazy, hazy",the distant hamlets,of men.
"Steady the smoke of the half-deserted village,","A dog barks somewhere in the deep lanes, A cock crows at",the top of the mulberry tree.
At gate and courtyard--no murmur,of the Worldâs dust: In the empty,rooms--leisure and deep stillness.
Long I lived checked by the,bars of a cage: Now I have turned again,to Nature and Freedom.
In the month of June the,grass grows high And round my cottage,thick-leaved branches sway.
There is not a bird but delights,in the place where it rests: And I,too--love my thatched cottage.
I have done,my ploughing: I,have sown my seed.
Again I have,time to sit and,read my books.
In the narrow lane there are,no deep ruts: Often my friendsâ,carriages turn back.
In high spirits I pour,out my spring wine And pluck the,lettuce growing in my garden.
A gentle rain comes stealing,up from the east And a sweet wind bears,it company.
My thoughts float idly over the story,of King Chou My eyes wander over the,pictures of Hills and Seas.
At a single,glance I survey the whole,Universe.
He will never be,"happy, whom such pleasures",fail to please!
"The lingering clouds, rolling,","rolling, And the settled rain, dripping, dripping,",In the Eight Directions--the same dusk.
The level,lands--one great,river.
"Wine I have, wine I",have: Idly I drink at the,eastern window.
Longingly--I think,"of my friends, But neither",boat nor carriage comes.
Swiftly,"the years, beyond",recall.
Solemn the stillness,of this fair,morning.
I will clothe myself,in spring-clothing And visit the,slopes of the Eastern Hill.
By the mountain-stream a,"mist hovers, Hovers a moment,",then scatters.
There comes a wind blowing,from the south That brushes the,fields of new corn.
I collected,together All,my friends.
Loud talk And simple feasting:,"Discussion of philosophy,",Investigation of subtleties.
Tongues loosened,And minds at,one.
Hearts refreshed,By discharge of,emotion!
High rises the,Eastern Peak Soaring up,to the blue sky.
Among the rocks--an,"empty hollow, Secret,","still, mysterious!"
"Uncarved and unhewn,",Screened by nature with a,roof of clouds.
"Times and Seasons, what",things are you Bringing to my,life ceaseless change?
I will lodge for ever,in this hollow Where Springs,and Autumns unheeded pass.
All night I could,not sleep Because of the,moonlight on my bed.
I kept on hearing,"a voice calling: Out of Nowhere,",Nothing answered âyes.
â I will carry my coat and,not put on my belt; With unpainted eyebrows,I will stand at the front window.
My tiresome petticoat,"keeps on flapping about; If it opens a little,",I shall blame the spring wind.
I heard my love was,going to Yang-chou And went with,him as far as Châu-shan.
For a moment when you held,me fast in your outstretched arms I thought the river,stood still and did not flow.
I have brought my pillow and am,"lying at the northern window, So come to",me and play with me awhile.
With so much quarrelling,and so few kisses How long do you,think our love can last?
Her door opened on the white water Close,by the side of the timber bridge: Thatâs where the little lady,lived All alone without a lover.
"Green rushes with red shoots, Long leaves",bending to the wind-- You and I in the same boat,Plucking rushes at the Five Lakes.
We started at dawn from,the orchid-island: We rested under,the elms till noon.
You and I plucking,rushes Had not plucked a handful,when night came!
âSeeing the plum-tree I thought of the Western,Island And I plucked a branch to send,to the North Country.
I put on my dress of,apricot-yellow silk And bound up my hair,black as the crowâs wing.
But which is the road,that leads to the Western,Island?
Iâll ask the man at,the ferry by the,Bridge of Boats.
But the sun is sinking and the,orioles flying home: And the wind is blowing,and sighing in the walnut-tree.
Iâll stand under the tree just,beside the gate: Iâll stand by the door,and show off my enamelled hair-pins.
"â Sheâs opened the gate, but",her lover has not come: Sheâs gone out,at the gate to pluck red lotus.
As she plucks the lotus on the,"southern dyke in autumn, The lotus flowers",stand higher than a manâs head.
She bends down--and plays with,"the lotus seeds, The lotus",seeds are green like the lake-water.
She gathers the flowers and,puts them into her gown-- The lotus-bud,that is red all through.
"She thinks of her lover, her lover",that does not come: She looks up and sees the wild geese flying--,The Western Island is full of wild geese.
To look for her,lover she climbs,the Blue Tower.
The tower is high: she,"looks, but cannot see: All day she leans",on the balcony rails.
The rail is,twisted into,a twelve-fold pattern.
She lets fall her,hand white like the colour,of jade.
"She rolls up the awning,","she sees the wide sky, And the sea-water",waving its vacant blue.
âThe sea shall carry my dreams far,"away, So that you shall be sorry",at last for my sorrow.
If the South wind--only knew my,thoughts It would blow my dreams till they got,to the Western Island.
â I was brought up under,the Stone Castle: My window opened,on to the castle tower.
In the castle were,beautiful young men Who waved to me as,they went in and out.
Chiang-nan is a glorious,"and beautiful land, And Chin-ling an",exalted and kingly province!
The green canals of the city,stretch on and on And its high towers,stretch up and up.
Flying gables lean over,the bridle-road: Drooping willows cover,the Royal Aqueduct.
Shrill flutes sing by the coachâs,"awning, And reiterated",drums bang near its painted wheels.
The names of the,deserving shall be carved,on the Cloud Terrace.
And for those who,have done valiantly,rich reward awaits.
Now late I follow Timeâs,Necessity: Mounting a barricade,I pacify remote tribes.
Discarding my sash I don a,coat of rhinoceros-skin: Rolling up my,skirts I shoulder a black bow.
Even at the very,start my strength fails: What will become of me,before itâs all over?
Red hills lie athwart us,"as a menace in the west, And fiery",mountains glare terrible in the south.
"The body burns, the","head aches and throbs: If a bird light here, its",soul forthwith departs.
Warm springs Pour from,cloudy pools And hot smoke issues,between the rocks.
The sun and moon are,perpetually obscured: The,rain and dew never stay dry.
There are red serpents,"a hundred feet long, And black snakes",ten girths round.
The sand-spitters shoot their poison at,the sunbeams: The flying insects are,ill with the shifting glare.
The hungry monkeys dare not,come down to eat: The morning birds,dare not set out to fly.
At the Ching river many die,of poison: Crossing the Lu one is lucky,if one is only ill.
Our living feet,walk on dead ground: Our high,wills surmount the snares of Fate.
The Spear-boat General,got but little honour: The,Wave-subduer met with scant reward.
If our Prince still grudges the things,"that are easy to give, Can he hope that his",soldiers will give what is hardest to give?
âI heard at night your,long sighs And knew that you,were thinking of me.
"â As she spoke, the doors of Heaven",opened And our souls conversed,and I saw her face.
She set me a,pillow to rest on And,she brought me meat and drink.
"I stood beside her where she lay, But suddenly","woke and she was not there: And none knew how my soul was torn, How",the tears fell surging over my breast.
In the high trees--many doleful,winds: The ocean waters--lashed,into waves.
If the sharp sword be not,"in your hand, How can you hope your friends",will remain many?
Do you not,see that sparrow,on the fence?
Seeing the hawk,it casts itself,into the snare.
The fowler to catch the,sparrow is delighted: The Young Man to,see the sparrow is grieved.
He takes his sword and,cuts through the netting: The yellow sparrow,"flies away, away."
"Away, away, up",to the blue sky And down again,to thank the Young Man.
A beautiful place,is the town of Lo-yang: The big streets,are full of spring light.
The lads go driving out with harps,in their hands: The mulberry girls go out,to the fields with their baskets.
Golden whips,glint at the,horsesâ flanks.
Gauze sleeves,brush the green,boughs.
"Racing dawn, the carriages","come home,-- And the girls with their high baskets",full of fruit.
My bed is so empty that,"I keep on waking up: As the cold increases,",the night-wind begins to blow.
"It rustles the curtains, making",a noise like the sea: Oh that those were waves,which could carry me back to you!
"Entering the Hall, she","meets the new wife: Leaving the gate, she runs",into her former husband.
Words stick: she does not manage to,say anything: She presses her hands,together and hesitates.
Agitates moon-like fan--sheds pearl-like tears-- Realizes,she loves him just as much as ever: That her present,pain will never come to an end.
Who says That itâs by my,"desire, This separation,",this living so far from you?
My dress still smells of the,lavender you gave: My hand still holds,the letter that you sent.
Round my waist I wear,a double sash: I dream that it binds us,both with a same-heart knot.
Did not you know that people,"hide their love, Like a flower that seems too",precious to be picked?
Of marsh-mallows my,"boat is made, The",ropes are lily-roots.
The pole-star is,athwart the sky: The,moon sinks low.
Itâs at,the ferry Iâm plucking,lilies.
But it might be the Yellow River--,"So afraid you seem of the wind and waves, So long",you tarry at the crossing.
The road that I came by mounts,eight thousand feet: The river that I,crossed hangs a hundred fathoms.
The brambles,so thick that in summer,one cannot pass!
The snow so,high that in winter,one cannot climb!
With branches that interlace,Lung Valley is dark: Against cliffs that tower,oneâs voice beats and echoes.
"I turn my head, and it",seems only a dream That I ever,lived in the streets of Hsien-yang.
The evening river is level,and motionless-- The spring colours,just open to their full.
Suddenly a wave carries,the moon away And the tidal water,comes with its freight of stars.
"Kao Huan, that",son of a mouse Dared,to attack King Pi.
But at the first stroke of sword,"and bow, The aggressorâs plot",recoiled on himself.
Tchirek River Lies under the,Dark Mountains: Where the sky is like the sides of a,tent Stretched down over the Great Steppe.
"The sky is gray, gray: And the","steppe wide, wide: Over grass that the wind has battered",low Sheep and oxen roam.
Business men boast of their skill,and cunning But in philosophy they,are like little children.
Bragging to each other of successful,depredations They neglect to consider the,ultimate fate of the body.
"âTell me now, what should a","man want But to sit alone, sipping",his cup of wine?
Then I could jog through a,"happy five-score years And, at the","end, need no Paradise."
"These days, continually","fuddled with drink, I fail to satisfy",the appetites of the soul.
But seeing men all,"behaving like drunkards, How can I",alone remain sober?
"âHis subjects were always original,","but his poems are seldom worth quoting,â is",a Chinese opinion of him.
"I loved you dearly,","Stone Fish Lake, With your rock-island shaped",like a swimming fish!
On the fishâs back is,"the Wine-cup Hollow And round the fish,--the flowing",waters of the Lake.
The boys on the shore sent little,"wooden ships, Each made to carry a",single cup of wine.
The island-drinkers emptied,the liquor-boats And set their sails and,sent them back for more.
On the shores of the Lake were,jutting slabs of rock And under the rocks,there flowed an icy stream.
"Heated with wine, to rinse",our mouths and hands In those cold waters,was a joy beyond compare!
Of gold and jewels I,have not any need; For Caps and,Coaches I do not care at all.
But I wish I could sit on the,rocky banks of the Lake For ever and ever,staring at the Stone Fish.
Above the lake are deep,"mountain valleys, And men dwelling",whose hearts are without guile.
"Gay like children, they swarm",to the tops of the trees; And run to,the water to catch bream and trout.
Their pleasures are the same as,those of beasts and birds; They put no restraint,either on body or mind.
Far I have wandered throughout,the Nine Lands; Wherever I went such,manners had disappeared.
I find myself standing and,"wondering, perplexed, Whether Saints and Sages",have really done us good.
The hills and rivers,of the lowland country You,have made your battle-ground.
How do you suppose,the people who live there Will,procure âfirewood and hayâ?
Do not let me hear you talking together,About titles and promotions; For a single generalâs,reputation Is made out of ten thousand corpses.
"Families, when a",child is born Want it to,be intelligent.
"I, through intelligence, Having","wrecked my whole life, Only hope the baby will",prove Ignorant and stupid.
Then he will crown a tranquil,life By becoming a Cabinet,Minister.
An old man selling,charms in a cranny of,the town wall.
He writes out spells,to bless the silkworms and spells,to protect the corn.
With the money he,gets each day he only,buys wine.
But he does not worry,"when his legs get wobbly, For he",has a boy to lean on.
Away and away,I sail in my light boat; My heart leaps with,a great gust of joy.
Through the leafless branches I,see the temple in the wood; Over the dwindling,stream the stone bridge towers.
Down the grassy lanes sheep,and oxen pass; In the misty,village cranes and magpies cry.
Back in my home I drink,a cup of wine And need not fear,the greed of the evening wind.
In the southern village,the boy who minds the ox With his naked,feet stands on the oxâs back.
Through the hole in his coat,the river wind blows; Through his broken,hat the mountain rain pours.
On the long dyke he seemed to,be far away; In the narrow lane,suddenly we were face to face.
The boy is home and the,ox is back in its stall; And a dark smoke,oozes through the thatched roof.
"Of Spring water,--thirty",or forty miles: In the,"evening sunlight,--three or four houses."
Youths and boys minding,geese and ducks: Women and girls tending,mulberries and hemp.
"The place,--remote: their coats","and scarves old: The year,--fruitful: their",talk and laughter gay.
The old wanderer moors,his flat boat And staggers up the bank to,pluck wistaria flowers.
The little cart,jolting and banging through the,yellow haze of dusk.
The man pushing,behind: the woman,pulling in front.
They have left the city,and do not know where,to go.
"âGreen, green, those elm-tree leaves: _they_ will cure","my hunger, If only we could find some quiet",place and sup on them together.
â The wind has flattened the yellow,mother-wort: Above it in the distance they,see the walls of a house.
â_There_ surely must be,people living whoâll give you,something to eat.
"â They tap at the door, but","no one comes: they look in, but",the kitchen is empty.
They stand hesitating,in the lonely road and their,tears fall like rain.
Since I left my home,to seek official state Seven,years I have lived in Châang-an.
What,have I,gained?
We have roamed on horseback under,the flowering trees; We have walked in the snow,and warmed our hearts with wine.
We have met and parted at,the Western Gate And neither of us,bothered to put on Cap or Belt.
We did not go up together,for Examination; We were not serving in,the same Department of State.
The bond that joined us,lay deeper than outward things; The rivers,of our souls spring from the same well!
I look down on,the Twelve City Streets:-- Red dust,flanked by green trees!
Coaches and horsemen alone,fill my eyes; I do not see whom my,heart longs to see.
Of all that walk on,the North-South Road There is not one that I care,for more than the rest!
At the palace doors the smell of,meat and wine; On the road the bones of,one who was frozen to death.
"Ten leagues riding, always",facing to the North; The cold wind,almost blew off my ears.
I waited for the bell outside,the Five Gates; I waited for the summons,within the Triple Hall.
My hair and beard were frozen,and covered with icicles; My coat,and robe--chilly like water.
At the western window I,paused from writing rescripts; The pines and bamboos,were all buried in stillness.
The moon rose and a,"calm wind came; Suddenly, it was like",an evening in the hills.
"And so, as I dozed, I dreamed",of the South West And thought I was staying,at the Hsien-yu Temple.
When I woke and heard the dripping,of the Palace clock I still thought it the,murmur of a mountain stream.
The snow has,gone from Chung-nan; spring is,almost come.
Lovely in the distance,"its blue colours, against the",brown of the streets.
"A thousand coaches, ten thousand",horsemen pass down the Nine Roads; Turns his head,"and looks at the mountains,--not one man!"
We talked together,in the Yung-shou Temple; We parted to the,north of the Hsin-châang dyke.
Going home--I shed a,"few tears, Grieving about","things,--not sorry for you."
"Long, long the road to",Lan-tâien; You said yourself you would,not be able to write.
Reckoning up your halts,for eating and sleeping-- By this time,youâve crossed the Shang mountains.
Last night the clouds scattered,"away; A thousand leagues, the",same moonlight scene.
"When dawn came, I dreamt I saw",your face; It must have been that you,were thinking of me.
"In my dream, I thought I",held your hand And asked you to tell,me what your thoughts were.
And _you_ said: âI miss you,"bitterly, But thereâs no one here to",send to you with a letter.
"â When I awoke, before","I had time to speak, A knocking on","the door sounded âDoong, doong!"
â They came and told me a,messenger from Shang-chou Had brought a,"letter,--a single scroll from you!"
Up from my pillow I,"suddenly sprang out of bed, And","threw you my clothes, all topsy-turvy."
I undid the knot and,saw the letter within; A single sheet,with thirteen lines of writing.
At the top it told the sorrows,of an exileâs heart; At the bottom it described,the pains of separation.
The sorrows and pains took,up so much space There was no room left,to talk about the weather!
But you said that when you wrote You were staying for the,"night to the east of Shang-chou; Sitting alone, lighted by a solitary",candle Lodging in the mountain hostel of Yang-ChâÄng.
Night was late when you,"finished writing, The mountain moon",was slanting towards the west.
What is it,lies aslant across,the moon?
A single tree of purple _paulovnia_ flowers--,Paulovnia flowers just on the point of falling Are a,symbol to express âthinking of an absent friend.
â Lovingly--you wrote on the back,"side, To send in the letter, your âPoem of",the Paulovnia Flower.
â The Poem of the Paulovnia,Flower has eight rhymes; Yet these eight couplets have,cast a spell on my heart.
They have taken hold of this,"morningâs thoughts And carried them to yours, the",night you wrote your letter.
The whole poem,I read three times; Each verse ten,times I recite.
So precious to me are the,fourscore words That each letter changes,into a bar of gold!
When the yellow birdâs note was almost stopped; And half,"formed the green plumâs fruit; Sitting and grieving that spring things were over,",I rose and entered the Eastern Gardenâs gate.
I carried my cup and was,dully drinking alone: Suddenly I,heard a knocking sound at the door.
"Dwelling secluded, I was","glad that someone had come; How much the more,",when I saw it was ChâÄn Hsiung!
"At ease and leisure,--all day","we talked; Crowding and jostling,--the",feelings of many years.
How great a,thing is a single,cup of wine!
For it makes us,tell the story of,our whole lives.
When I was almost forty,I had a daughter whose name,was Golden Bells.
Now it is just a year since,she was born; She is learning to,sit and cannot yet talk.
"Ashamed,--to find that I have",not a sageâs heart: I cannot resist,vulgar thoughts and feelings.
Henceforward I am,"tied to things outside myself: My only reward,--the",pleasure I am getting now.
If I am spared the grief of,"her dying young, Then I shall have the",trouble of getting her married.
My plan for retiring,and going back to the hills Must now,be postponed for fifteen years!
"Ruined and ill,--a man","of two score; Pretty and guileless,--a",girl of three.
"Not a boy,--but, still better","than nothing: To soothe oneâs feeling,--from",time to time a kiss!
"There came a day,--they suddenly",took her from me; Her soulâs shadow,wandered I know not where.
"At last, by thinking of the time","before she was born, By thought and reason",I drove the pain away.
"Since my heart forgot her, many",days have passed And three times winter,has changed to spring.
"This morning, for a little,","the old grief came back, Because, in the","road, I met her foster-nurse."
"Sad, sad--lean with long illness;","Monotonous, monotonous--days",and nights pass.
The summer trees have clad,themselves in shade; The autumn âlanâ already,houses the dew.
The eggs that lay in the,nest when I took to bed Have changed into little,birds and flown away.
The worm that then lay hidden,in its hole Has hatched into a cricket,sitting on the tree.
The Four Seasons go on for,ever and ever: In all Nature nothing stops,to rest Even for a moment.
Only the sick,manâs heart Deep down still aches,as of old!
"Deep the waters of the Black Pool,",coloured like ink; They say a Holy Dragon,"lives there, whom men have never seen."
Beside the Pool they have built a shrine; the authorities,have established a ritual; A dragon by itself remains,"a dragon, but men can make it a god."
"Prosperity and disaster, rain and drought,",plagues and pestilences-- By the village people were all,regarded as the Sacred Dragonâs doing.
They all made offerings of sucking-pig and poured,libations of wine; The morning prayers and evening gifts,"depended on a âmediumâsâ advice When the dragon comes, ah!"
The wind stirs,and sighs Paper,"money thrown, ah!"
Silk,umbrellas,waved.
When the,"dragon goes,",ah!
The,wind,also--still.
The cups,and vessels,are cold.
Meats lie stacked on the rocks,of the Poolâs shore; Wine flows on the grass,in front of the shrine.
"I do not know, of all those offerings,",how much the Dragon eats; But the mice of the woods and the foxes,of the hills are continually drunk and sated.
Why are,the foxes,so lucky?
"What have the sucking-pigs done,","That year by year _they_ should be killed,",merely to glut the foxes?
That the foxes are robbing the Sacred,"Dragon and eating His sucking-pig, Beneath the nine-fold depths","of His pool, does He know or not?"
There came an officer,knocking by night at my door-- In a,loud voice demanding grain-tribute.
My house-servants dared not wait till,"the morning, But brought candles",and set them on the barn-floor.
"Passed through the sieve,","clean-washed as pearls, A whole cart-load, thirty",bushels of grain.
But still they cry that it is,not paid in full: With whips and curses,they goad my servants and boys.
"Once, in error, I entered",public life; I am inwardly ashamed,that my talents were not sufficient.
In succession I,occupied four official posts; For,"doing nothing,--ten yearsâ salary!"
Often have I heard that,saying of ancient men That âgood and ill,follow in an endless chain.
â And to-day it ought to set,my heart at rest To return to others,the corn in my great barn.
In the land of Tao-chou Many,of the people are dwarfs; The tallest of them,never grow to more than three feet.
They were sold in the market as dwarf,slaves and yearly sent to Court; Described as âan offering,of natural products from the land of Tao-chou.
â A strange âoffering of natural productsâ;,I never heard of one yet That parted men from,"those they loved, never to meet again!"
Old men--weeping for their,grandsons; mothers for,their children!
One day--Yang ChâÄng came to govern,the land; He refused to send up dwarf slaves,in spite of incessant mandates.
â The Emperorâs heart was deeply,moved and he sealed and sent a scroll âThe yearly tribute,of dwarfish slaves is henceforth annulled.
â The people of,"Tao-chou, Old ones and young ones,",how great their joy!
Father with son and brother with,brother henceforward kept together; From that day,for ever more they lived as free men.
The people,of Tao-chou Still enjoy,this gift.
And even now when,they speak of the Governor,Tears start to their eyes.
And lest their children and their childrenâs children,"should forget the Governorâs name, When boys are born the",syllable âYangâ is often used in their forename.
Of cord and cassia-wood,is the harp compounded: Within it,lie ancient melodies.
Ancient melodies--weak and,"savourless, Not appealing",to present menâs taste.
Light and colour are,faded from the jade stops: Dust has,covered the rose-red strings.
Decay and ruin came,"to it long ago, But the sound that",is left is still cold and clear.
I do not refuse to play,"it, if you want me to: But even if","I play, people will not listen."
How did it come,to be neglected,so?
Because of,the Châiang flute and the,Châin flageolet.
The singers have hushed their,notes of clear song: The red sleeves of the,dancers are motionless.
"Hugging his lute, the old",harper of Chao Rocks and sways as he,touches the five chords.
The loud notes swell and,"scatter abroad: âSa, sa,â like",wind blowing the rain.
The soft notes dying,"almost to nothing: âChâieh, châieh,â like the",voice of ghosts talking.
Now as glad as the magpieâs,lucky song: Again bitter as the,gibbonâs ominous cry.
And those who sit and listen,to the tune he plays Of soul and body,lose the mastery.
And those who pass that way as,"he plays the tune, Suddenly stop",and cannot raise their feet.
"Alas, alas that the",ears of common men Should love the,modern and not love the old.
Thus it is that the harp in,the green window Day by day is,covered deeper with dust.
In the Royal City,"spring is almost over: Tinkle, tinkle--the",coaches and horsemen pass.
We tell each other âThis is the,peony seasonâ: And follow with the,crowd that goes to the Flower Market.
âCheap and dear--no uniform price:,The cost of the plant depends on the,number of blossoms.
"For the fine flower,--a hundred",pieces of damask: For the cheap,"flower,--five bits of silk."
Above is spread an awning,to protect them: Around is woven a,wattle-fence to screen them.
If you sprinkle water and,"cover the roots with mud, When they are transplanted,",they will not lose their beauty.
â Each household thoughtlessly,"follows the custom, Man by man, no",one realizing.
There happened to be,an old farm labourer Who,came by chance that way.
He bowed his head and sighed,a deep sigh: But this sigh,nobody understood.
"He was thinking, âA cluster",of deep-red flowers Would pay the taxes of,ten poor houses.
â Tartars,"led in chains, Tartars",led in chains!
"Their ears pierced, their",faces bruised--they are driven,into the land of Châin.
The Son of Heaven,took pity on them and would not,have them slain.
A petty officer in a yellow coat,took down their names and surnames: They were led from the city,of Châang-an under escort of an armed guard.
Their bodies were covered,"with the wounds of arrows, their",bones stood out from their cheeks.
They had grown so,weak they could only march,a single stage a day.
In the morning they must satisfy hunger,and thirst with neither plate nor cup: At night they must lie in,their dirt and rags on beds that stank with filth.
Suddenly they came to the,Yangtze River and remembered the,waters of Chiao.
With lowered hands,and levelled voices they sobbed,a muffled song.
Then one Tartar lifted up his,"voice and spoke to the other Tartars, â_Your_ sorrows are none",at all compared with _my_ sorrows.
â Those that were with him in the same,band asked to hear his tale: As he tried to speak,the words were choked by anger.
He told them,âI was born and bred in the town,of Liang-yÃ¼an.
In the frontier wars,of Ta-li I fell into,the Tartarsâ hands.
Since the days the Tartars took me alive,forty years have passed: They put me into a coat,of skins tied with a belt of rope.
Only on the first,of the first month might I wear,my Chinese dress.
As I put on my,"coat and arranged my cap,",how fast the tears flowed!
I made in my heart a secret vow I,would find a way home: I hid my plan from my Tartar wife,and the children she had borne me in the land.
"I thought to myself, âIt is well for me that","my limbs are still strong,â And yet, being old, in my heart I",feared I should never live to return.
The Tartar chieftains shoot so well that the,birds are afraid to fly: From the risk of their arrows I,escaped alive and fled swiftly home.
"Hiding all day and walking all night,",I crossed the Great Desert: Where clouds are dark and the moon,black and the sands eddy in the wind.
But the moving horsemen did not hear,that I spoke the Han tongue: Their Captain took me for,a Tartar born and had me bound in chains.
"They are sending me away to the south-east,",to a low and swampy land: No one now will take pity,on me: resistance is all in vain.
"Thinking of this, my voice chokes and I","ask of Heaven above, Was I spared from death only",to spend the rest of my years in sorrow?
My native village of Liang-yÃ¼an I,shall not see again: My wife and children in the Tartarsâ,land I have fruitlessly deserted.
"When I fell among Tartars and was taken prisoner,",I pined for the land of Han: Now that I am back in the land,"of Han, they have turned me into a Tartar."
Had I but known what,"my fate would be, I would not",have started home!
"For the two lands, so","wide apart, are alike in",the sorrow they bring.
Tartar,prisoners,in chains!
Of all the sorrows,of all the prisoners mine,is the hardest to bear!
Never in the world has so great a wrong,"befallen the lot of man,-- A Han heart and a Han",tongue set in the body of a Turk.
â A,Government-bull yoked to,a Government-cart!
Moored by the bank,"of Châan River, a barge",loaded with gravel.
A single load,"of gravel, How many",pounds it weighs!
Carrying at,"dawn, carrying at dusk, what",is it all for?
They are carrying,"it towards the Five Gates, To",the West of the Main Road.
Under the shadow,of green laurels they are,making a gravel-drive.
"For yesterday arrove, newly appointed, The","Assistant Chancellor of the Realm, And was terribly afraid",that the wet and mud Would dirty his horseâs hoofs.
The Chancellorâs horseâs hoofs Stepped on the,gravel and remained perfectly clean; But the bull employed,in dragging the cart Was almost sweating blood.
The Assistant Chancellorâs,"business Is to âsave men, govern the country",And harmonize Yin and Yang.
â Whether the bullâs neck,is sore Need not trouble,him at all.
There was once a man who dreamt,he went to Heaven: His dream-body,soared aloft through space.
He rode on the back of,"a white-plumed crane, And was led on his flight",by two crimson banners.
Whirring of wings,and flapping of,coat tails!
Jade bells,suddenly,all a-tinkle!
"Half way to Heaven, he","looked down beneath him, Down on the dark",turmoil of the World.
Gradually he,lost the place of his native town; Mountains,and water--nothing else distinct.
The Eastern Ocean--a single,"strip of white: The Hills of China,--five",specks of green.
Gliding past him a host of fairies,swept In long procession to the Palace,of the Jade City.
They take him to the presence of,the Mighty Jade Emperor: He bows his,head and proffers loyal homage.
The Emperor says: âWe see,you have fairy talents: Be of good,heart and do not slight yourself.
We shall send to fetch you in,fifteen years And give you a place in the,Courtyard of Immortality.
"â Twice bowing, he acknowledged","the gracious words: Then woke from sleep, full",of wonder and joy.
He hid his secret and dared,not tell it abroad: But vowed a vow,he would live in a cave of rock.
From love and affection he severed,kith and kin: From his eating and drinking he,omitted savoury and spice.
His morning meal was a,dish of coral-dust: At night he sipped an,essence of dewy mists.
In the empty mountains he,lived for thirty years Daily watching for,the Heavenly Coach to come.
The time of appointment,"was already long past, But",of wings and coach-bells--still no sound.
His teeth and hair daily withered,and decayed: His ears and eyes gradually,lost their keenness.
One morning he suffered the Common,Change And his body was one with the,dust and dirt of the hill.
Gods,and,fairies!
If indeed such things there,"be, Their ways are beyond the",striving of mortal men.
â Though you sweat and,"toil, what shall your",trouble bring?
You will only,shorten the five-score,years of your span.
"Sad, alas, the",man who dreamt of,Fairies!
For a single,dream spoiled his,whole life.
"Boundless,",the great,sea.
"Straight down,--no","bottom: sideways,--no",border.
Of cloudy waves and misty billows,"down in the uttermost depths Men have fabled,",in the midst there stand three sacred hills.
On the,"hills, thick growing,--herbs that banish",Death.
Wings grow on those who,eat them and they turn into,heavenly âhsien.
â The Lord of Châin and Wu of Han,believed in these stories: And magic-workers year by,year were sent to gather the herbs.
"The Blessed Islands,","now and of old, what",but an empty tale?
The misty waters,spread before them and they knew,not where to seek.
"Dauntless,",the mighty,wind.
Their eyes search but,cannot see the shores of,the Blessed Islands.
They cannot find the Blessed Isles and yet,they dare not return: Youths and maidens that began,the quest grew grey on board the boat.
Do you not see The graves,on the top of Black Horse Hill,and the tombs at Mo-ling?
What is left but the,sighing wind blowing in the,tangled grasses?
The Two Red Towers,North and south rise facing,each other.
I beg to,"ask, to whom do",they belong?
The two Princes blew on their flutes and,"drew down fairies from the sky, Who carried them off through the","Five Clouds, soaring away to Heaven."
"Their halls and houses, that they","could not take with them, Were turned into Temples",planted in the Dust of the World.
In the tiring-rooms and dancersâ towers all,is silent and still; Only the willows like dancersâ,"arms, and the pond like a mirror."
When the flowers are falling at yellow,"twilight, when things are sad and hushed, One does not hear","songs and flutes, but only chimes and bells."
The Imperial Patent on the,Temple doors is written in letters of gold; For nunsâ quarters,and monksâ cells ample space is allowed.
For green moss and bright moonlight--plenty of room,provided; In a hovel opposite is a sick,man who has hardly room to lie down.
I remember once when at Pâing-yang they were,building a great manâs house How it swallowed up the housing,space of thousands of ordinary men.
"The Immortals are leaving us, two","by two, and their houses are turned into Temples; I begin to",fear that the whole world will become a vast convent.
An old charcoal-seller Cutting wood,and burning charcoal in the forests,of the Southern Mountain.
"His face, stained with dust","and ashes, has turned to",the colour of smoke.
The hair on his temples,is streaked with gray: his ten,fingers are black.
The money he gets,"by selling charcoal, how",far does it go?
It is just enough,to clothe his limbs and put food,in his mouth.
"Although, alas, the",coat on his back is a coat,without lining.
He hopes for the coming,"of cold weather, to send up",the price of coal!
"Last night, outside the city,--a whole",foot of snow; At dawn he drives the charcoal,wagon along the frozen ruts.
"Oxen,--weary; man,--hungry: the sun, already","high; Outside the Gate, to the south of the Market,",at last they stop in the mud.
"Suddenly,",a pair of prancing,horsemen.
Who,can it be,coming?
A public official,in a yellow coat and a,boy in a white shirt.
In their hands they hold a written warrant:,on their tongues--the words of an order; They turn back the wagon and curse,"the oxen, leading them off to the north."
A whole wagon,"of charcoal, More than",a thousand pieces!
If officials choose,"to take it away, the woodman",may not complain.
Half a piece of red silk and a single yard,"of damask, The Courtiers have tied to the oxenâs collar,",as the price of a wagon of coal!
I was going to the City to,sell the herbs I had plucked; On the way I rested,by some trees at the Blue Gate.
Along the road there came,a horseman riding; Whose face was pale,with a strange look of dread.
"Friends and relations, waiting","to say good-bye, Pressed at his side, but",he did not dare to pause.
"I, in wonder, asked the",people about me Who he was and,what had happened to him.
They told me this was a,Privy Councillor Whose grave duties were,like the pivot of State.
His food allowance was ten,thousand cash; Three times a day the,Emperor came to his house.
Yesterday he was called to,a meeting of Heroes: To-day he is banished,to the country of Yai-chou.
"So always, the Counsellors",of Kings; Favour and ruin changed,between dawn and dusk!
"Green, green,--the grass of the Eastern","Suburb; And amid the grass, a",road that leads to the hills.
Resting in peace among the,"white clouds, At last he has made",a âcoupâ that cannot fail!
At Hsin-fÄng an old man--four-score and,eight; The hair on his head and the hair of,his eyebrows--white as the new snow.
"Leaning on the shoulders of his great-grandchildren,",he walks in front of the Inn; With his left arm he leans,on their shoulders; his right arm is broken.
I asked the old man how many years,had passed since he broke his arm; I also asked the cause of the,"injury, how and why it happened?"
The old man said he was born and reared,in the District of Hsin-fÄng; At the time of his,birth--a wise reign; no wars or discords.
âOften I listened in the Pear-Tree Garden to,the sound of flute and song; Naught I knew of banner and,lance; nothing of arrow or bow.
Then came the wars of Tâien-pao,and the great levy of men; Of three men,"in each house,--one man was taken."
And those to,"whom the lot fell, where",were they taken to?
"When the great army waded across, the",water seethed like a cauldron; When barely ten had entered,"the water, two or three were dead."
"To the north of my village,",to the south of my village the sound of,weeping and wailing.
Children parting,from fathers and mothers; husbands,parting from wives.
Everyone says that in expeditions,against the Min tribes Of a million men who,"are sent out, not one returns."
"I, that am old, was then",twenty-four; My name and fore-name were written down,in the rolls of the Board of War.
In the depth of the night not daring,to let any one know I secretly took a huge,stone and dashed it against my arm.
Bones broken and sinews wounded,could not fail to hurt; I was ready enough to,"bear pain, if only I got back home."
My arm--broken ever,since; it was sixty,years ago.
"One limb, although","destroyed,--whole body",safe!
But even now on winter,nights when the wind and rain blow From evening on till dayâs,dawn I cannot sleep for pain.
Not sleeping for pain Is a,"small thing to bear, Compared with the joy of being",alive when all the rest are dead.
"For otherwise, years ago, at the ford",of Lu River My body would have died and my soul,hovered by the bones that no one gathered.
Over the graves of,"ten thousand soldiers, mournfully",hovering.
â So,the old man,spoke.
And I bid you listen to his words Have you not,"heard That the Prime Minister of Kâai-yÃ¼an, Sung Kâai-fu, Did not reward frontier exploits,",lest a spirit of aggression should prevail?
And have you not heard That the Prime Minister,"of Tâien-Pao, Yang Kuo-chung Desiring to win imperial","favour, started a frontier war?"
But long before he could win the,"war, people had lost their temper; Ask the man with",the broken arm in the village of Hsin-fÄng?
White billows and huge waves block the river,"crossing; Wherever I go, danger and difficulty;","whatever I do, failure."
Just as in my worldly career I,"wander and lose the road, So when I come to the river","crossing, I am stopped by contrary winds."
Of fishes and prawns sodden in the rain,the smell fills my nostrils; With the stings of insects that,"come with the fog, my whole body is sore."
I am growing,"old, time flies, and my short",span runs out.
While I sit in,"a boat at Chiu-kâou,",wasting ten days!
I take your poems in my hand and,read them beside the candle; The poems are finished:,the candle is low: dawn not yet come.
With sore eyes by the guttering candle,"still I sit in the dark, Listening to waves that, driven","by the wind, strike the prow of the ship."
I have still to travel in my solitary,boat three or four leagues-- By misty waters and rainy,"sands, while the yellow dusk thickens."
"The forest trees are leafless and withered,--after",the mountain rain; The roofs of the houses are hidden,low among the river mists.
"The horses, fed on water grass, are",too weak to carry their load; The cottage walls of wattle,and thatch let the wind blow on oneâs bed.
In the distance I see red-wheeled coaches,"driving from the town-gate; They have taken the trouble, these civil","people, to meet their new Prefect!"
There is no one among men that,has not a special failing: And my failing,consists in writing verses.
I have broken away from,the thousand ties of life: But this,infirmity still remains behind.
"And often, when I have finished","a new poem, Alone I climb the road",to the Eastern Rock.
I lean my body on the,banks of white stone: I pull down with my,hands a green cassia branch.
My mad singing startles,the valleys and hills: The apes and,birds all come to peep.
Fearing to become a,"laughing-stock to the world, I choose a place that is",unfrequented by men.
"At Nine Rivers, in the tenth year,","in winter,--heavy snow; The river-water covered with ice",and the forests broken with their load.
"The birds of the air, hungry and","cold, went flying east and west; And with them flew a migrant","âyen,â loudly clamouring for food."
Among the snow it pecked for grass; and rested,on the surface of the ice: It tried with its wings to scale,the sky; but its tired flight was slow.
The boys of the river spread a net,and caught the bird as it flew; They took it in their hands,to the city-market and sold it there alive.
I that was once a man of the,"North am now an exile here: Bird and man, in their","different kind, are each strangers in the south."
And because the sight of an exiled bird,"wounded an exileâs heart, I paid your ransom and set","you free, and you flew away to the clouds."
"Yen, Yen, flying","to the clouds, tell me, whither",shall you go?
The official army and the rebel army,have grown old in their opposite trenches; The soldierâs rations,"have grown so small, theyâll be glad of even you."
"The brave boys, in their hungry plight, will shoot",you and eat your flesh; They will pluck from your body those,long feathers and make them into arrow-wings!
"_You_, so bravely",splashing reds,and blues!
Just when _I_,am getting wrinkled,and old.
Why should you waste the moments,of inspiration Tracing the withered,limbs of a sick man?
"Tall, tall is the Palace",of Châi-lin; But my deeds have not been,frescoed on its walls.
Minutely limned on a,foot of painting silk-- What can I do,with a portrait such as _that_?
Yesterday I heard,that such-a-one was gone; This morning they,tell me that so-and-so is dead.
Of friends and acquaintances,more than two-thirds Have suffered change and,passed to the Land of Ghosts.
Those that are gone I shall not,"see again; They, alas, are for",ever finished and done.
Those that are,"left,--where are",they now?
"They are all scattered,--a",thousand miles,away.
Those I have known and loved,"through all my life, On the fingers of",my hand--how many do I count?
Longing for each other we are,all grown gray; Through the Fleeting World rolled,like a wave in the stream.
Alas that the feasts and,frolics of old days Have withered and,"vanished, bringing us to this!"
When shall we meet and,drink a cup of wine And laughing gaze,into each otherâs eyes?
"Up and up,",the Incense-burner,Peak!
In my heart,is stored what my eyes,and ears perceived.
All the year--detained by,official business; To-day at last,I got a chance to go.
"Grasping the creepers, I",clung to dangerous rocks; My hands,and feet--weary with groping for hold.
There came with me,"three or four friends, But two friends dared",not go further.
At last we reached the topmost,"crest of the Peak; My eyes were blinded,",my soul rocked and reeled.
The chasm beneath,me--ten thousand feet; The ground I,"stood on, only a foot wide."
If you have not exhausted the scope,"of seeing and hearing, How can you realize",the wideness of the world?
The waters of the River,"looked narrow as a ribbon, PâÄn Castle",smaller than a manâs fist.
"How it clings,",the dust of the worldâs,halter!
It chokes my,limbs: I cannot,shake it away.
"Thinking of retirement,","I heaved an envious sigh, Then, with lowered","head, came back to the Antsâ Nest."
My new Province is a,land of bamboo-groves: Their shoots in spring,fill the valleys and hills.
The mountain woodman cuts an,armful of them And brings them down to,sell at the early market.
Things are cheap in proportion,"as they are common; For two farthings,",I buy a whole bundle.
I put the shoots in a,great earthen pot And heat them up,along with boiling rice.
The purple nodules,"broken,--like an old brocade; The","white skin opened,--like new pearls."
Now every day,I eat them recklessly; For a,long time I have not touched meat.
Sent as a present,from Annam-- A red,cockatoo.
Coloured like the peach-tree,"blossom, Speaking with",the speech of men.
And they did to it,what is always done To the,learned and eloquent.
They took a,cage with stout bars And shut,it up inside.
After lunch--one short,nap: On waking up--two,cups of tea.
"Raising my head, I",see the sunâs light Once again,slanting to the south-west.
Those who are happy regret,the shortness of the day; Those who are sad,tire of the yearâs sloth.
But those whose hearts are devoid,"of joy or sadness Just go on living,",regardless of âshortâ or âlong.
"â Above, a mountain ten","thousand feet high: Below, a river",a thousand fathoms deep.
"A strip of green, walled by",cliffs of stone: Wide enough for the,passage of a single reed.
Long before night the,walls are black with dusk; Without,wind white waves rise.
The big rocks are like,a flat sword: The little rocks,resemble ivory tusks.
We are stuck,fast and cannot,move a step.
How much the,"less, three hundred",miles?
"Frail and slender, the twisted-bamboo","rope: Weak, the dangerous hold",of the towersâ feet.
A single slip--the whole,convoy lost: And _my_ life,hangs on _this_ thread!
I have heard a saying âHe that has,an upright heart Shall walk scathless through,the lands of Man and Mo.
â How can I believe that,since the world began In every,shipwreck none have drowned but rogues?
"And how can I, born","in evil days And fresh from failure,",ask a kindness of Fate?
Often I fear that,these un-talented limbs Will be laid,at last in an un-named grave!
"Suddenly, suddenly,--bearing","a stricken heart I left the gates,",with nothing to comfort me.
"Henceforward,--relegated to deep seclusion In a bottomless","gorge, flanked by precipitous mountains, Five months on end the passage of boats",is stopped By the piled billows that toss and leap like colts.
The inhabitants of Pa,"resemble wild apes; Fierce and lusty,",they fill the mountains and prairies.
Among such as these I cannot hope,for friends And am pleased with anyone who,is even remotely human!
I took money and bought,flowering trees And planted them out on,the bank to the east of the Keep.
I simply bought whatever,"had most blooms, Not caring whether","peach, apricot, or plum."
"A hundred fruits, all mixed","up together; A thousand branches,",flowering in due rotation.
Each has its season coming,early or late; But to all alike the,fertile soil is kind.
The red flowers hang like,a heavy mist; The white flowers gleam,like a fall of snow.
The wandering bees cannot,bear to leave them; The sweet birds also,come there to roost.
In front there flows an ever-running,stream; Beneath there is built a little,flat terrace.
Sometimes I sweep the flagstones,"of the terrace; Sometimes, in the wind,",I raise my cup and drink.
The flower-branches screen my head,from the sun; The flower-buds fall,down into my lap.
"Alone drinking, alone singing",my songs I do not notice that the,moon is level with the steps.
The people of Pa do not,care for flowers; All the spring,no one has come to look.
"But their Governor General,",alone with his cup of wine Sits till evening,and will not move from the place!
"My niece, who is six","years old, is called âMiss Tortoiseâ; My","daughter of three,--little âSummer Dress."
â One is beginning to learn,to joke and talk; The other can already,recite poems and songs.
At morning they play clinging,about my feet; At night they sleep,pillowed against my dress.
"Why, children, did you reach","the world so late, Coming to me",just when my years are spent?
Young things draw our,feelings to them; Old people,easily give their hearts.
The sweetest vintage,at last turns sour; The full,moon in the end begins to wane.
And so with men the bonds of,love and affection Soon may change to a,load of sorrow and care.
But all the world is bound,by loveâs ties; Why did I think that I,alone should escape?
Trees growing--right in front of,my window; The trees are high,and the leaves grow thick.
the distant mountain,"view Obscured by this, dimly",shows between.
One morning I took,knife and axe; With my own hand I,lopped the branches off.
Ten thousand leaves fall about,my head; A thousand hills came,before my eyes.
"Suddenly, as when clouds or mists break And straight through,","the blue sky appears; Again, like the face of a friend one has",loved Seen at last after an age of parting.
First there came a gentle,wind blowing; One by one the birds,flew back to the tree.
To ease my mind I gazed to,"the South East; As my eyes wandered,",my thoughts went far away.
Of men there is none that has,not some preference; Of things there is,none but mixes good with ill.
It was not that I did,not love the tender branches; But,"better still,--to see the green hills!"
I have been ill so long that,I do not count the days; At the southern,"window, evening--and again evening."
Sadly chirping in the,grasses under my eaves The winter,sparrows morning and evening sing.
By an effort I rise and lean,heavily on my bed; Tottering I,step towards the door of the courtyard.
By chance I meet a friend who,is coming to see me; Just as if,I had gone specially to meet him.
They took my couch and placed it in,the setting sun; They spread my rug and,I leaned on the balcony-pillar.
Tranquil talk was better than,any medicine; Gradually the,feelings came back to my numbed heart.
Little sleeping and much,"grieving,--the traveller Rises at midnight",and looks back towards home.
The sands are bright with moonlight,that joins the shores; The sail is white with,dew that has covered the boat.
"Nearing the sea, the river grows","broader and broader: Approaching autumn,--the",nights longer and longer.
Thirty times we have,"slept amid mists and waves, And",still we have not reached Hang-chow!
I grew up,at Jung-yang; I was still,young when I left.
"On and on,--forty years passed",Till again I stayed for,the night at Jung-yang.
"When I went away, I",was only eleven or twelve;,This year I am turned fifty-six.
Yet thinking back to the,"times of my childish games, Whole and undimmed,",still they rise before me.
The old houses have all,disappeared; Down in the village,none of my people are left.
It is not only that streets,and buildings have changed; But steep is level,and level changed to steep!
"Alone unchanged, the waters","of Châiu and Yu Passionless,--flow",in their old course.
"While on the road to his new province, Hang-chow, in 822,","he sends a silver spoon to his niece A-kuei, whom he had been obliged to leave","behind with her nurse, old Mrs."
Little girls ought to,be daintily,fed: Mrs.
"Tsâao,",please see to,this!
Thatâs why Iâve packed and sent a,silver spoon; You will think of me and,eat up your food nicely!
Long ago to a white-haired,gentleman You made the present,of a black gauze hat.
The gauze hat still sits on,my head; But you already are gone,to the Nether Springs.
"The thing is old, but still",fit to wear; The man is gone and,will never be seen again.
Out on the hill the moon is,shining to-night And the trees on your tomb,are swayed by the autumn wind.
That so many of the,poor should suffer from cold what can,we do to prevent?
To bring warmth to,a single body,is not much use.
I wish I had a big rug,"ten thousand feet long, Which at one time could cover",up every inch of the City.
Our party scattered at yellow dusk,and I came home to bed; I woke at midnight and went for,"a walk, leaning heavily on a friend."
As I lay on my pillow my vinous,"complexion, soothed by sleep, grew sober; In front of the tower the ocean","moon, accompanying the tide, had risen."
"The swallows, about to return to the beams,","went back to roost again; The candle at my window, just","going out, suddenly revived its light."
"All the time till dawn came, still my thoughts",were muddled; And in my ears something sounded,like the music of flutes and strings.
"_Then_ on the shore,--building","sand-pagodas; _Now_, at Court, covered with",tinkling jade.
"This and that,--equally childish","games, Things whose substance passes in",a moment of time!
"While the hands are busy, the",heart cannot understand; When there are no,"Scriptures, then Doctrine is sound."
Even should one zealously,"strive to learn the Way, That very striving",will make oneâs error more.
All the morning I have,lain perversely in bed; Now at,dusk I rise with many yawns.
My warm stove is quick to,get ablaze; At the cold mirror I,am slow in doing my hair.
With melted snow I,boil fragrant tea; Seasoned with,curds I cook a milk-pudding.
At my sloth and greed there,is no one but me to laugh; My cheerful vigour,none but myself knows.
The taste of my wine is mild and,works no poison; The notes of my harp,are soft and bring no sadness.
To the Three Joys in the book,of Mencius I have added the,fourth of playing with my baby-boy.
I break up cypress,and make a book-box; The box,"well-made,--and the cypress-wood tough."
In it shall be,kept what authorâs,works?
The inscription,says PO,LO-TâIEN.
All my life has been spent,"in writing books, From when I was young",till now that I am old.
"First and last,--seventy","whole volumes; Big and little,--three",thousand themes.
All I can do is to divide them,among my daughters To be left by them,to give to my grandchildren.
"Between thirty and forty, one is","distracted by the Five Lusts; Between seventy and eighty,",one is a prey to a hundred diseases.
But from fifty to,sixty one is free from all ills;,Calm and still--the heart enjoys rest.
I have put behind me Love and Greed; I,have done with Profit and Fame; I am still short of illness,and decay and far from decrepit age.
Strength of limb I still possess to,seek the rivers and hills; Still my heart has spirit,enough to listen to flutes and strings.
At leisure I open new,wine and taste several cups; Drunken I recall,old poems and sing a whole volume.
"â Hundreds of houses,","thousands of houses,--like",a chess-board.
The twelve streets,like a field planted with,rows of cabbage.
"In the distance perceptible, dim,",dim--the fire of approaching dawn; And a single row,of stars lying to the west of the Five Gates.
Mounting on high I begin to realize,the smallness of Manâs Domain; Gazing into distance I begin,to know the vanity of the Carnal World.
I turn my head and hurry,"home--back to the Court and Market, A single",grain of rice falling--into the Great Barn.
Two top-knots not,yet plaited into,one.
Of thirty,years--just beyond,half.
You who are really a lady,of silks and satins Are now become my,hill and stream companion!
At the spring fountains together,we splash and play: On the lovely trees,together we climb and sport.
"Her cheeks grow rosy, as","she quickens her sleeve-dancing: Her brows grow sad,",as she slows her songâs tune.
Donât go singing the Song of,"the Willow Branches, When thereâs no one",here with a heart for you to break!
At night you came and took my hand and we wandered,together in my dream; When I woke in the morning there was no one to,stop the tears that fell on my handkerchief.
On the banks of the Châang my aged body,three times has passed through sickness; At Hsien-yang to the grasses,on your grave eight times has autumn come.
You lie buried beneath,the springs and your bones are,mingled with the clay.
I--lodging in the,world of men; my hair,white as snow.
A-wei and Han-lang both followed in,their turn; Among the shadows of the Terrace,of Night did you know them or not?
"At night, in my","dream, I stoutly climbed",a mountain.
Going out alone,with my staff of,holly-wood.
"A thousand crags, a hundred hundred valleys-- In",my dream-journey none were unexplored And all the while my feet never grew tired,And my step was as strong as in my young days.
Can it be that when the,mind travels backward The body also,returns to its old state?
"And can it be, as between","body and soul, That the body may","languish, while the soul is still strong?"
Soul and body--both are,vanities: Dreaming and waking--both,alike unreal.
In the day my feet are palsied,and tottering; In the night my steps,go striding over the hills.
As day and night are,divided in equal parts-- Between the,"two, I _get_ as much as I _lose_."
Congratulating himself on,the comforts of his life after his,retirement from office.
"Lined coat, warm cap and easy felt slippers,","In the little tower, at the low window, sitting",over the sunken brazier.
"Body at rest,",heart at peace; no need to,rise early.
I wonder if the courtiers,at the Western Capital know,"of these things, or not?"
No new poems his,brush will trace: Even,his fame is dead.
His old poems are deep,in dust At the bottom of,boxes and cupboards.
"Once lately, when someone was singing,",Suddenly I heard a verse-- Before I had time,to catch the words A pain had stabbed my heart.
âThose who speak know,nothing; Those who know,are silent.
"â These words, as","I am told, Were spoken",by Lao-tzÅ­.
If we are to believe that Lao-tzÅ­,"Was himself _one who knew_, How comes it that he wrote",a book Of five thousand words?
Chuang-tzÅ­ levels all things,And reduces them to,the same Monad.
But _I_ say that,even in their sameness,Difference may be found.
A traveller,came from across the seas Telling,of strange sights.
âIn a deep fold of the,sea-hills I saw a terrace,and tower.
In the midst there,stood a Fairy Temple With,one niche empty.
They all told me,this was waiting,For Lo-tâien to come.
"â Traveller, I have studied the Empty Gate;",I am no disciple of Fairies The story you,have just told Is nothing but an idle tale.
The hills of,ocean shall never,be Lo-tâienâs home.
When I leave the earth,it will be to go To the Heaven,of Bliss Fulfilled.
They have put my bed beside the,unpainted screen; They have shifted my stove,in front of the blue curtain.
"I listen to my grandchildren,","reading me a book; I watch the servants,",heating up my soup.
With rapid pencil I answer,the poems of friends; I feel in my pockets,and pull out medicine-money.
When this superintendence of,"trifling affairs is done, I lie back on my",pillows and sleep with my face to the South.

"For me, only,",are all things,yet mute.
Who will then tell me in whispers,and where must I find just the window Where one day she'll,be glimpsed: creature who'll scorch me with love?
Can't I divine yet the paths through,which over and over To her and from her,"I'll go, squandering valuable time?"

"With my business accomplished, ah,","then shall only one temple, AMOR's temple","alone, take the initiate in."
"Rome, thou art a whole world, it","is true, and yet without love this World would not be the","world, Rome would cease to be Rome."
More than ever I,"dreamed, I have found it: my",happy good fortune!
Cupid,sagaciously led,past those palazzos so fine.
He of course knows very well (and I,"have also discovered) What, beneath tapestries","rich, gilded boudoirs conceal."
One may if one wishes,"call him a blind, wanton boy--but I know you,","Clever Cupid, too well!"
"O,",incorruptible,god!
"Here he provides me with ev'rything,",sees that I get what I call for; Each day that passes,he spreads freshly plucked roses for me.
--Isn't that,heaven,on earth?
"Say, beautiful","Lady Borghese, What would you",give to me more?
Banquets and game,"tables, operas, balls, promenades",down the Corso?
These but deprive,my sweet boy of his,most opportune times.
"Finery,",haughtiness do,not entice me.
Does one not lift a,Gown of the finest brocade just as,one lifts common wool?
If she's to press in comfort a,"lover against that soft bosom, Doesn't he want",her to be free from all brooches and chains?
"Must not the jewelry, and then the",lace and the bustles and whalebone All of it come,"off entire, if he's to learn how she feels?"
I encounter,no troubles,like those.
"Simple dress of rough homespun,","At but a lover's mere touch, tumbles",in folds to the floor.
Quickly he carries the girl as,she's clad in chemise of coarse linen-- Just as a nursemaid,"might, playfully up to her bed."
Drapings of satin,are absent; the mattress is,quite unembroidered.
Large is this room where,the bed offers its,comfort for two.
Jupiter's welcome to more from his,Juno if he can get it; Let any mortal find,"rest, softer, wherever he can."
"We are content with Cupid's delights,",authentic and naked-- And with the exquisite,creak /crack of the bed as it rocks.
Ask whomever you will but you'll,"never find out where I'm lodging, High society's","lords, ladies so groomed and refined."
"""Tell me,",was Werther,authentic?
Did all of,that happen in,real life?
""" ""Lotte, oh where did she","live, Werther's only",true love?
""" How many times have I cursed those",frivolous pages that broadcast Out among all,mankind passions I felt in my youth!
"Were he my brother,",why then I 'd have murdered,poor Werther.
Yet his despondent,ghost couldn't have sought,worse revenge.
"Do not, beloved, regret that",you yielded to me so quickly: I entertain,"no base, insolent thoughts about you."
Arrows,of Cupid work divers,effects.
Some do but scratch us:,Slow and insidious these,poison our hearts over years.
Yet with a head freshly honed and,"cunningly fledged, certain others Pierce to the marrow,",inflame rapidly there our blood.
When gods and goddesses in days of,"heroes made love, then Lust followed look and desire,","with no delay, was indulged."
Surely you don't think the goddess of,"love lost a moment reflecting When, in","Idean grove, Anchises caught her eye."
Nor did Luna delay about kissing,that beautiful dreamer-- Jealous Aurora had,else hastily wakened the lad.
At the loud banquet Hero regarded,"Leander--then promptly Into dark waters he plunged,",ardently swam toward his love.
Today a proud Rome,claims to be queen,of the world.
We are,"so pious,",we lovers.
Discreetly we worship,"all powers, Hoping for favor from each",god and each goddess as well.
Therefore we gladly confess to singling,a special immortal And our devotions each,day pledging but solely to her.
Mischievous celebrants we at these,"mysteries gay, and so solemn: Silence exactly",befits rites at which we're adepts.
Sweet,"Opportunity,",that is her name.
You,should,meet her.
Often will she,"turn up, ever",in a new form.
Daughter of Proteus,might well she be whom he sired,upon Thetis.
In metamorphoses,they've many a hero,deceived.
So now the daughter beguiles the naive,"and bedazzles the foolish, Teases you while you're","asleep; when you awaken, she's flown."
Eagerly yields herself,"up to the quick, to the active",man only.
He discovers,"she's tame, playful and",tender and sweet.
"Once she appeared to me, too:","a dark-skinned girl, tumbling Over her forehead",the hair down in waves heavy and dark.
Round about a delicate neck,curled short little ringlets; Up from the crown of,her head crinkled the unbraided hair.
When she dashed,"by me I seized her,",mistaking her not.
Lovingly Kiss and,"embrace she returned, knowing",and teaching me how.
O how,enraptured,I was!
"Ah, say",now no,more.
It's,a,bygone.
"But, O pigtails","of Rome, still I'm",entrammled in you.
Happily now on,classical soil I feel,inspiration.
Voices from present,and past speak here,evocatively.
"Heeding ancient advice,",I leaf through the works of the Ancients,With an assiduous hand.
Daily,the pleasure's,renewed.
"Throughout the night, in a different","way, I'm kept busy by Cupid-- If erudition","is halved, rapture is doubled that way."
Do then I not become wise when,"I trace with my eye her sweet bosom's Form, and",the line of her hips stroke with my hand?
"I acquire, As I reflect and compare,","my first understanding of marble, See with an eye","that feels, feel with a hand that sees."
"While my beloved, I grant it,","deprives me of moments of daylight, She in",the nighttime hours gives compensation in full.
And we do more than just kiss; we,prosecute reasoned discussions (Should she succumb to,"sleep, that gives me time for my thoughts)."
In her embrace--it's by no means unusual--I've composed poems,"And the hexameter's beat gently tapped out on her back, Fingertips counting",in time with the sweet rhythmic breath of her slumber.
Air from deep in,her breast penetrates,mine and there burns.
"Cupid, while stirring the flame in our","lamp, no doubt thinks of those days when For the triumvirs",he similar service performed.
"""Can you be cruel",enough to sadden me thus with,reproaches?
"Germans speak,","I suppose, bitterly",when they're in love.
Bear it I must when the,gossips bring forth accusations:,I'm guilty-- Or am I not?
"But, alas, all",of my guilt was,with you.
Clothes that you've given bear witness for,envious neighbors That the poor widow no,more grieves for her husband alone.
Did you not thoughtlessly visit,"me in the disguise of a cleric, Muffled all up in","a cloak, hair all rounded behind?"
Who was,it chose that gray monk if,not you?
Well then a prelate,"Now is my lover--Ah, who is",my prelate but you?
"Never, incredible as it","may sound in this clerical city, Has any cleric",brought me--swear it I will--to his bed.
I was,sufficiently,"poor, sad to say."
The,seducers Noted,it well.
Falconier,ogled me often,enough.
One of the pimps for Albani,with billets doux very impressive,Called me to Ostia once.
Quattro,Fontani,next time.
Who was,it did not appear,there?
"Why, who but the very",same girl who Hated with all of her heart,stockings both violet and red.
For: 'In the end you,poor girls are the ones who are,sure to be cheated.
 So said my,father although--Mother was,not much impressed.
Father,was,right.
Here I stand in,the end being cheated,and scolded.
You don't believe,your own,words.
They're your,excuse to,escape.
Unworthy,of women are,men.
"We, who carry your children","Next to our hearts, in these hearts loyalty","we bear you, too."
"As for you men, when you've poured out your",potency in our embraces And your desires,"dissipate, love with them passes away."
""" These things expressed, and taking her child","from its chair, my beloved Presses it close to","her heart, kisses it, tears in her eyes."
I'm now so very ashamed of,myself for having permitted Gossip of neighbors,to spoil picture so eloquent.
For a short moment,a fire may burn darkly,while smoke swirls about it.
Water dashed on,the coals suddenly smothers,their glow.
Rapidly then renewed heat overcomes,"those lowering vapors, Sends up a flame that anew",bright and more powerful gleams.
How very happy I am here,in Rome when I think of the bad days Far back,"there in the north, wrapped in a grayish light."
Over my head there the heavens weighed,"down so dismal and gloomy; Colorless, formless,",that world round this exhausted man lay.
"Seeking myself in myself, an","unsatisfied spirit, I brooded, Spying out pathways","dark, lost in dreary reflection."
Phoebus the god,"evokes forms, clear are",his colors by day.
"Bright with the stars comes the evening,","ringing with songs that are tender, And the glow","of the moon, brighter than northern sun."
What,blessedness mortals,may know!
Am,I now,dreaming?
Or welcomes,"Jupiter, Father, as guest--me,",to ambrosial halls?
"See, I lie here",extending my arms,toward your knees.
I am praying:,"Hospitality's god,",Jupiter Xenius!
Hear: How I am come,to this place I no longer,can say--I was Seized up by Hebe.
Twas she,led to this sacred,hill.
Did you command her,a hero to seek and,deliver before you?
May be,she,erred.
Let her,mistake profit,me!
"Does not Fortuna, your daughter,","when strewing her glorious presents, After the manner","of girls, yield to each passing whim?"
"You, O hospitable god, will by",no means now banish a stranger From your Olympian,heights back to the base earth again.
"""--Forgive me, Jupiter, is not",Rome's Capitoline Hill second,Olympus to you?
"Suffer me, Jupiter, here and",let Hermes guide me at last then Past Cestius',Tomb gently to Orkus below.
"When you were small, you say, neither did others consider","you f air, nor Even your mother find praise--and I believe it-- Till you grew","bigger, developing quietly over the years."
I Picture you,to myself as an,unusual child.
Also the blossoms on grapevines are wanting,"in shape and in color, Although the fruit when it's",ripe pleases both mankind and gods.
Kindling autumnal fire in a,"rustic, convivial fireplace (How the sticks crackle",and spew flames and glittering sparks!
) Strikes me,especially pleasant,this evening.
"Then in the morning, officious,","she'll leave the bed of her lover, Rouse adroitly",the flames out from their ashes anew.
Cupid has lent to her above,others the gift of cajoling Up from the ashes,"desire, just when slumber's begun."
"Therefore, ye living, rejoice that","love keeps you warm for a while yet, Until cold","Lethe anoints, captures your foot in its flight."
"They are for you, O ye graces, just a","few leaves by a poet Onto your pure altar laid, buds","of the rose beside, Offered in confidence."
"But it's to Bacchus, the sensuous","dreamer, Cythera sends glances Bathed in sweetest",desire--even in marble they're damp.
Thinking about his embrace and its,"pleasures, she seems to be asking Shouldn't our",glorious son here at our side stand erect?
"Can't you hear voices,","beloved, out on the Via",Flamina?
Reapers are now,"going home, back from",harvesting grain.
"They had journeyed to Rome from afar,",and here plaited for Ceres Wreaths which the Romans,today scorn to make for themselves.
Festivals no longer celebrate,"Ceres, the nourishing goddess Who replaced acorns","of old, giving man golden wheat."
Let us commemorate her,then ourselves in festival private (Two constitute,"a whole tribe, when they are two in love)."
Have you by any chance heard how that,"mystical, strange celebration Followed victorious",troops back from Eleusis to Rome?
"Greeks were the ones who began it, and",only to Greeks they proclaimed it Even within Roman,"walls: ""Come to the sanctified night."
""" Those who were not of the cult kept","their distance; neophytes trembled, Waiting in garments of","white, symbol of all that is pure."
Then the initiates must aimlessly,wander about through the eerie Circles of figures as,if pilgriming through their own dreams.
Snakes on the,ground were writhing,about.
Surely the gestures of murmuring,priests must contain some deep meaning-- Impatient,"acolytes wait, anxiously hoping for light."
Not until after many a testing,"and trial did they discover What, within sacred","ring, secretive image concealed."
What was this mystery other,"than this:   that Demeter, goddess, Once upon a",time had to a hero been kind.
"It was to Jason, powerful king","of the Cretans, she granted Of her immortal",self hidden sweet parts to explore.
That made,the fortune,of Crete!
The marital bed of the,"goddess Soon grew pregnant with grain, heavy",her bounteous fields.
"As for the rest of the world, it","languished away, while Ceres, Derelict of her true","task, dalliance offered in love."
"--Now the initiate youths, having","followed this tale, all astonished, Turned and beckoned","their loves--love, do you comprehend?"
See there the sacred,shade beneath that bushy-boughed,myrtle?
Our satisfaction,will there scarcely endanger,a world.
Cupid is always,"a scoundrel, and if you believe",him he'll cheat you.
Here's what the hypocrite,"said: ""Trust me just once","more, this time."
I have the best of intentions toward,you who have now dedicated-- I recognize,it with thanks--life and writings to me.
"Lo, I have followed you hither to","Rome, and I'd like to do something Here in this far away",land pleasing to such an old friend.
Every traveller I've ever,known has complained of poor treatment: He whom I,recommend treatment delicious receives.
How you've revered,the formative will of,those ancient artists!
In their own,ateliers often I,ve visited them.
"As for their works, why,",I formed those myself--now this time,I'm boasting Not.
"Oh come now, admit",what I am saying,is true.
Where are your own,"creations, your service to",me having slackened?
Where is,invention's,glow now?
Where is,the color,all gone?
"Friend, do you",hope you can create,again?
--The school of the Ancients,Yet remains,open.
"Its gates,",years have not closed,them to you.
I am eternally,"young, and as teacher I still",love the young ones.
Wisdom that comes,with old age pleases,me not.
Listen here: Wasn't,antiquity young when those fortunate,Ancients were living?
Happy then be,"your life, too: in it",antiquity lives.
Where will,you find a fit theme for,your song?
--It is,I must,provide it.
As for a style,"truly grand, love can",alone give you that.
""" All of these claims",that sophist,asserted.
Could I,contradict,him?
I am wont to,"obey, when my",commander decrees.
Treacherous now he is keeping his word:,giving me themes for my poems While he is stealing,"my time, potency, presence of mind."
"Gazing into her eyes, holding hands, giving kisses,","exchanging Syllables sweet and those words lovers alone understand, Murmuring our",conversations we stutter in sweet oratory.
Hymns of such sort pass,"away, wanting",prosodical tact.
"Goddess of morning,","Aurora, as friend of my",muse I once knew you.
Has the unprincipled,"god, Cupid, seduced",you now too?
So that these mornings you come as his,"sweetheart, awakening me at His festive altar","again, where I must celebrate him?"
"Here on my breast flows her hair, an","abundance of curls, while her head rests, Pressing my","arm as it's bent, so as to pillow her neck."
"Love in our hearts makes us one,",as the genuine need there stays constant; Only,returning desire knows oscillation or change.
Gently her hand presses,"mine, now she opens her eyes and is",looking Into my own eyes.
Let my,thoughts rest,on your form!
Please,close your,eyes.
"They're inebriation,","confusion, they rob me All too soon of",the joy quiet reflection affords.
Grand are the forms of,this body and nobly,positioned each member.
Had Ariadne,"lain thus, Theseus",never had fled.
Only a single kiss for,"these lips and then, O Theseus, leave",her; Look at her eyes--she's awake!
Now you're,eternally,bound.
"Boy, won't",you light me,a lamp.
"""But dear master,",there's light in the sky,yet.
Don't waste,your oil and,the wick.
Don't close,the shutters,so soon.
Only the houses,"are blocking the sun there, it's",not yet the mountains.
Until the curfew,"shall ring, full half an",hour must pass.
""" Wretched young","fellow, be gone and",obey me!
My loved,one is,coming.
"Lamplight, console","me till then, harbinger",warm of the night.
Poets of old in chorus cried out against those,"two serpents, Making them horrible names, hated in all of the world: Python","the one, the other the Hydra of Lerna."
These monsters Both,"have now been destroyed, thanks to the",deeds of the gods.
"Fire-breathing, venomous once, they",no longer now depredate our Flocks,"and meadows and woods, fields of golden grain."
How is it then that some spiteful,god in his wrath has Raised from the poisonous slime offspring,so monstrous again?
There's an insidious viper creeps,"into the loveliest gardens, Lying in wait",to attack all who seek pleasure therein.
Noble Hesperian,"dragon, I call you courageous",and forthright.
Boldly defending,your own beautiful apples,of gold.
"As for this worm, why he is not guarding","at all, for his presence Sullies both garden and","fruit, till they deserve no defense."
Happy Lucretius knew how in,"his day to forego love completely, Fearing not",to enjoy pleasure in anyone's arms.
"Fortunate Ancient, Propertius,",for you a slave fetched the girls down From the,"Aventine Hill, from Tarpeia's grove."
"Cynthia then, when driving you out","of such unchaste embraces, Found you unfaithful,","it's true, but she did find you whole."
Who would today dare attempt,to escape from fidelity's,ennui?
Love does not,hold one back--only concern,for one's health.
Even the woman we love may afford,us uncertain enjoyment; Nowhere can feminine,lap safely encouch a man's head.
Matrimonial bed's insecure,"and so's fornication; Husband, lover and",wife pass to each other the hurt.
Think of those ages of gold when,"Jupiter followed his urges, Chose Callisto","one day, turned to Semel the next."
It was important to him to find,"thresholds of temples so sacred Pure when, enamoured,",he sought powerful entry to them.
Can you imagine the ragings of,Juno if in love's skirmish Poisonous weapons on,her by her own spouse had been turned?
But we neo-pagans may not after all be,abandoned entirely: Yet there is speeding a god mercifully,"over the earth, Quick and assiduous."
Everyone knows him and ought,"to adore him, Herald of Zeus:","Hermes, the healing god."
"Cupid will hold out his hand: O, and entrusting","myself to the rascal, I beg you please may I Do so in pleasure",with no danger or worry or fear.
I cannot think I'd have gone with,Julius Caesar to Britain; To the Popina,"right here, Florus would tug me with ease."
Fogs of the dreary north remain,a more baleful remembrance Than in the kitchens,of Rome tribes of assiduous fleas.
"After today, I'll remember you even","more kindly, tavernas, You osterias, as you","are called, aptly by those here in Rome."
That was the place I encountered my,mistress today with the uncle Whom she so often,"deceives, so that she can have me."
She is of course well aware That,"I am watching, so finally makes the V of the","Roman Five, with a virgule before."
"Quickly, as soon as I've seen, She interlaces","the circles, reducing them all to ornatest Patterns--but still the",sweet IV stood as engraved in my eye.
I sat there mutely and biting my passionate lips almost,"bloody Half from delight at the ruse, partly from stifled desire: Such a","long time until dark, then another four hours of waiting."
"--Sun, who tarries on high, contemplating Rome: Greater","never you've nor shall you in future see greater Than Rome, O","sun, as your priest, Horace, enraptured foretold."
Tarry,no longer,today.
Go seek other,realms beneath,heaven.
Sooner depart,and leave Rome's seven,famed hills to me.
Please do the poet a favor,and shorten the glorious hours Which the painter,"devours, eagerly filling his eyes."
Then Hastily,plunge to the,ocean.
"First were but few simple dwellings here,",suddenly sunlight discovered Nations enlivening,hills teeming with fortunate thieves.
Onto this spot they assembled such,"plunder, in your eye so splendid All earth's remaining",orb scarcely was worthy of note.
"You watched a world being born here, watched","the same world sink to ruin, And from those ruins","yet arise world again greater, perhaps."
O may I,long by your light,now behold this Rome.
O but come rushing,the moment my love designated,so sweetly.
"--No, but",I heard at least,three.
"Thus, my dear muses,",again you've beguiled the,monotony for me.
Of this long interval,while I was apart,from my love.
All,"of you now,",farewell!
I'll be going,now--don't be,offended.
"For, though you're proud, you'll",concede: Cupid in,my heart comes first.
Why did you fail to,appear at the cot in the,"vineyard today, Love?"
As I had promised,"I would, long I awaited",you there.
"""Dear, I had almost arrived when I","saw, by good fortune, your uncle Standing right there by","the vines, looking now this way, now that."
Stealthily,I slipped,away.
You saw,"the scarecrow,",that's all.
Nothing,else drove you,away.
Reeds and some discarded garments all,hastily cobbled together-- I helped to make,it myself: diligent in my own grief.
"""Well, now",his wish,is fulfilled.
The old gardner's most dissolute,crow has Left on this day unscathed nice little,garden and niece.
""" While there is many an","unpleasant sound, I hate to hear barking",Worse than anything else.
Bellowing,dogs split my,ears.
"Nevertheless I do like to hear,",and take pleasure in listening To the loud,howl of the dog raised from a pup next door.
That is the dog that so bayed one time,at my girl that he almost Gave our secret,away (when she was visiting me).
"Now, when I hear the dog barking I think",my beloved is coming-- Or I remember,"the time, when long awaited she came."
I can tell not only about a discomfort,"far greater than others, But of a horror besides, thinking of which",will arouse Every fiber in me to revulsion.
"My friends, I confess it:",Great displeasure I take lying,alone in my bed.
That's why Faustina as my companion,in bed makes me happy: Loving she always remains,"faithful, as I am to her."
Young men are aroused in their passions by,obstacles and by excitement; I prefer to,"go slow, savoring pleasures secure."
Is it not bliss to exchange tender,"kisses containing no dangers, Sucking into our","lungs, carefree, our partner's own life?"
That is the way our,long nights of enjoyment,are passed.
"We listen, Breast against breast, to the storm, pouring down rain","in the wind Morning begins to dawn, we expect from these hours approaching",Blossoms that will adorn festive the coming new day.
"Quirites, permit me the joy, and may","this, of all pleasures on earth the First and the last,",be vouchsafed all of mankind by the god.
"Ah, to uphold",one's respectable,name is not easy.
The Lady Fame,"has an ancient foe: Cupid,",my master and lord.
"Oh, by the way, have",you heard of the cause of their,mutual hatred?
"It's an old story,",I think--Let me just tell it,again.
"Powerful ever the goddess, but",nevertheless to her fellows Overbearing,"and rude, quite unendurable."
She Had by the gods since time out of,"mind at their banquets been dreaded, Yelling with brassiest",voice orders to great and to small.
"Once, in her arrogance even maintained","that she had subjected To her own will, as her","slave, Jove's most illustrious son."
"""One of these days, O father of","deities,"" cried she in triumph, ""I shall be","bringing you my--Hercules, as if new born."
Don't think that Hercules be still that,boy whom Alcmene once bore you; His adulation,of me makes him now god upon earth.
When toward Olympus,"he gazes, I've no doubt you hope that he's",looking Piously toward your knees.
He's,looking,for me.
O the vision of winning my,"favor makes easy Hitherto unexplored paths,",under that powerful foot.
"I do my part, for I meet him halfway",and proclaim his adventures Praising his name in,"advance, even before he's begun."
One day,you'll wed me to,Hercules.
Hero who,Amazons conquered That,day will overwhelm me.
Happily,I'll call him:,spouse.
""" All of the gods kept their counsel, and","none would reply to the braggart, Lest in a pique she",devise vengeance against one of them.
"Scene now completed and ready to tease,","he goes scampering, shouting For all Olympus","to hear: ""Come, see these glorious deeds!"
Heaven and Earth and the Sun on his,indefatigable journey Over that,infinite path never did witness the like!
""" Everyone hastened, gulled by the","dissolute boy, who feigning Earnest, had summoned",them all (Fame by no means lagged behind).
Which of the gods will,now smile in sweet condescension,on Cupid?
"delighted, of course,",seeing a man,humbled so.
"Fame, on the other","hand, stood there ashamed, embarrassed,",despairing.
First she just,"laughed, saying: ""Gods, be",not deceived.
It's,a,masque.
I know my hero,too well to be fooled by,disguises of actors.
""" Soon, though, in","pain she perceived: Hercules,",none but he.
"How those boys, Bacchus and Mercury, guffawed, and","freely admitted: Sweet must be the repose, lying on bosom",so fine Of this magnificent woman.
They turned to Vulcan,"entreating: ""Do not release",them just yet.
Let us,inspect them,once more.

") As for poor Fame,","in all haste, burning",with wrath she must flee.
Since then no armistice,has been proclaimed to the feuding,between them.
Let her but favor,"a man, hot in pursuit",is the boy.
He whom Fame honors most can least,"defend against Cupid, And her most dang'rous attacks",strike the most morally proud.
Whoever tries to,escape him is dragged down from,bad deeds to worse ones.
"Yes, he will offer you girls--if like a fool you despise","These, only then do you feel from his bow the arrows most vicious: Heat","of man's love for man, ardent desires toward beasts."
For those ashamed of him Cupid,"reserves the bitterest passions, Mingling for hypocrites",their pleasure in vice and remorse.
"But, at the same time,","the goddess seeks him, she's",watching and list'ning.
"Should find him with you, ill disposed will she be: Frighten","you, frowning austerely, contemptuously, violently casting Into",the worst of repute houses he's known to frequent.
"Ah, it's the",same with,"me, too."
I haven't,"escaped her, the",goddess.
Jealously she,"seeks me out, sweet secret",love to expose.
I will submit to the ancient,"law and in silence revere her, For, when great lords","fall out, I like the Greeks must atone."
"However comely be strength, or","free and undaunted comportment, Secrecy is for",a man most important of all.
"Mighty subduer of cities,","Discretion, O princess of nations, Goddess whom","I adore, safely you've led me thus far."

"Difficult is it, alas, to conceal the","shame of a monarch; Hide it can neither his crown, nor a",tight Phrygian cap: Midas has asses ears!
the first,servant discovers--O,horror!
Shame of this secret,"so weighs, Midas",unburdens his heart.
Into the earth for safekeeping the,"servant must bury the story, Easing in this",way the king:  earth must conceal the tale.
Reeds in a trice are sprouting and,"rustling in murmuring breezes: ""Midas, o Midas",the King--bears the ears of an ass!
""" Mine is a secret more pleasant, but",even more difficult keeping: Out of abundance,of heart eagerly speaketh my mouth.
None of my ladyfriends dare I confide,"in, for they would but chide me; Nor any gentleman","friend, lest he be rival to me."

One can do that if,"one's young, or if one's",lonely enough.
"I to hexameters tell, in",pentameters I will confide it: During the,"day she was joy, happiness all the night long."

Faggots are heaped all about me against the,"cold of the winter, Which I so hate for the crows settling then","down on my head, Which they befoul very shamefully."
Summer's no better: the servants,"Empty their bowels and show insolent,",naked behinds.
"Filth,",above and,below!
I was clearly in danger,"of turning Into filth myself, toadstool,",rotten wood!
"Now, by your efforts, O","noblest of artists, I shall recover With",fellow gods my just place.
And it's,no more than,my due.
"Jupiter's throne, so dishonestly","won, it was I who secured it: Color and ivory,","marble and bronze, not to mention the poems."
"Now, all intelligent",men look upon me,in kindness.
They like to Form their,"own image of me, just as",the poet has done.
Nor do the girls take,offense when they see me--by no,means the matrons.
None finds me ugly,"today, though I am",monstrously strong.
